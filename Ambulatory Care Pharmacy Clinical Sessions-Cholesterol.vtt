0:00:00 --> 0:00:04,560000
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the session entitled the Cholesterol Limbo,

2
0:00:04,560000 --> 0:00:09,400000
How Low Should You Go. For those that are coming in the back there are a number of

3
0:00:09,400000 --> 0:00:14,360000
seats available up front if you can't find any in the back. My name is Joel

4
0:00:14,360000 --> 0:00:17,280000
Mars. I'm a professor at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center on

5
0:00:17,280000 --> 0:00:21,880000
her national campus and we also have Matt Kosoff who's an associate professor at

6
0:00:21,880000 --> 0:00:28,680000
Northeast Ohio Medical Center. We don't, neither one of us has any financial

7
0:00:28,680000 --> 0:00:33,480000
relationships to disclose. The key focus of this morning's session is going to

8
0:00:33,480000 --> 0:00:37,680000
highlight some of the recent trends and guidelines and consensus documents over

9
0:00:37,680000 --> 0:00:41,800000
the last couple years that have highlighted or driven down some of the

10
0:00:41,800000 --> 0:00:46,360000
recommendations to go even lower especially in our very high-risk AS CBD

11
0:00:46,360000 --> 0:00:52,140000
folks. Additionally then we'll kind of review some of the clinical trials that

12
0:00:52,140000 --> 0:00:56,720000
drove some of those changes in kind of the middle section and then lastly we'll

13
0:00:56,760000 --> 0:01:00,620000
highlight some sub-populations and specifically some of the scenarios or

14
0:01:00,620000 --> 0:01:04,620000
issues that come up in managing older individuals with hyper-clustral

15
0:01:04,620000 --> 0:01:10,120000
EMEA and some of the evidence there. We have a few abbreviations that we'll use

16
0:01:10,120000 --> 0:01:16,240000
throughout our presentation. We all know that hyper-lipidemia is a common problem

17
0:01:16,240000 --> 0:01:20,780000
in the US and worldwide and so based on the most recent statistics from the

18
0:01:20,780000 --> 0:01:26,200000
AHA that they publish each January shows that about a third of adults have

19
0:01:26,200000 --> 0:01:31,220000
LDL above 130 and so we're going to talk about predominantly a lot of the trial

20
0:01:31,220000 --> 0:01:34,860000
data that's been focused on secondary prevention but we will dove into some of

21
0:01:34,860000 --> 0:01:40,420000
the primary prevention data looking at aggressive lipid lowering. So with that I

22
0:01:40,420000 --> 0:01:44,700000
will transition it over to Dr. Kosoff.

23
0:01:44,700000 --> 0:01:52,780000
Alright thank you Joel. Joel's a little under the weather this morning but he's

24
0:01:52,780000 --> 0:01:58,740000
fighting a good fight a lot better than I would so give it up to Joel for being

25
0:01:58,740000 --> 0:02:04,100000
strong over there. So we'll start with the recent guidelines and recommendations

26
0:02:04,100000 --> 0:02:10,940000
so you know this there's been a you know a pretty a pretty big shift the past few

27
0:02:10,940000 --> 0:02:16,860000
years you know I start here with the 2018 guidelines but you know even if we

28
0:02:16,860000 --> 0:02:22,140000
go back five five years before that so in the 2013 you know lipid guidelines

29
0:02:22,140000 --> 0:02:27,300000
there was this simplified kind of approach that came with these fixed

30
0:02:27,300000 --> 0:02:31,660000
dose statins and I think when we start looking at these newer guidelines

31
0:02:31,660000 --> 0:02:37,580000
recommendations and trials we're really moving away I think from that that

32
0:02:37,620000 --> 0:02:43,660000
simplified approach that you know for some pharmacists I think they kind of

33
0:02:43,660000 --> 0:02:46,300000
entered this period of time where they weren't really thinking about these

34
0:02:46,300000 --> 0:02:51,620000
non-statin options some of these advanced testing and you know now it's

35
0:02:51,620000 --> 0:02:56,820000
shifting back to this more complex and in a dualized management so I think it

36
0:02:56,820000 --> 0:03:00,820000
really creates an exciting opportunity for us pharmacists to then step in and

37
0:03:00,820000 --> 0:03:07,300000
help our kind of collaborative teams and our place within the healthcare team

38
0:03:07,300000 --> 0:03:13,740000
to manage these patients with lipid. So 2018 guidelines it was similar to 2013

39
0:03:13,740000 --> 0:03:17,300000
as far as you know reinforcing these statin benefit groups we'll talk about it

40
0:03:17,300000 --> 0:03:22,300000
but we started to see some some shift towards you know this bringing back these

41
0:03:22,300000 --> 0:03:28,700000
LDL targets goals and thresholds that was further supported with our European

42
0:03:28,700000 --> 0:03:34,420000
guidelines in 2019 and then in 2020 with the endocrinology guidelines so we

43
0:03:34,460000 --> 0:03:39,460000
start to see support for even lower goals and we've ever seen before especially

44
0:03:39,460000 --> 0:03:46,940000
in these very high-risk patients. USPSTF we'll talk about that especially you

45
0:03:46,940000 --> 0:03:51,860000
know I'll come back later and talk about our older adults and then really there

46
0:03:51,860000 --> 0:03:57,420000
are more recent document the expert consensus decision pathway document

47
0:03:57,420000 --> 0:04:02,740000
last year really helps us with some of these non-statin therapy options and

48
0:04:02,740000 --> 0:04:06,500000
we'll talk about it but even since that time there have been more trials that

49
0:04:06,500000 --> 0:04:14,220000
arguably that guideline needs another update. So we'll start here with a patient case

50
0:04:14,220000 --> 0:04:20,340000
you know a 66 year old man, past medical history of hypertension hospitalized eight

51
0:04:20,340000 --> 0:04:26,980000
months ago for an MI you can see the meds here taking a pseudo statin 40

52
0:04:27,060000 --> 0:04:34,540000
blood pressure meds aspirin and then the lipid panel so something to just just

53
0:04:34,540000 --> 0:04:42,460000
put it in mind of kind of context what we're gonna be talking so really our

54
0:04:42,460000 --> 0:04:46,700000
question here is you know according to these 2018 guidelines what's the target

55
0:04:46,700000 --> 0:04:53,340000
LDL reduction and LDL threshold. Alright so I'll give you guys some time to get

56
0:04:53,340000 --> 0:04:56,340000
your answers in here.

57
0:05:10,140000 --> 0:05:16,460000
Alright so with this one so our kind of pre-pre-case answer here most are leaning

58
0:05:16,460000 --> 0:05:24,620000
towards a greater than 50% LDL reduction LDL threshold of greater than 70 and

59
0:05:24,620000 --> 0:05:31,020000
then the next question we have what would be the most appropriate invention for

60
0:05:31,020000 --> 0:05:39,500000
this patient. Alright so even more more than the previous slide so a lot

61
0:05:39,500000 --> 0:05:46,980000
leaning towards edamame so we'll we'll go through it and stick with that

62
0:05:46,980000 --> 0:05:53,960000
answer. Okay so our 2018 guideline you know from five years ago now reinforced

63
0:05:53,960000 --> 0:05:59,540000
our statin benefit groups so clinical ACPD so these folks with ACPD high

64
0:05:59,540000 --> 0:06:06,540000
intensity statin you know because we have this geriatrics focus focus to do the

65
0:06:06,540000 --> 0:06:13,060000
session we'll talk about the you know our older older populations guidelines

66
0:06:13,060000 --> 0:06:18,700000
you know we'll talk more about it but that 75 year old cutoff is where we see a

67
0:06:18,700000 --> 0:06:24,060000
lot of these. I said the most clever thing I was gonna say all day when you

68
0:06:24,060000 --> 0:06:32,260000
guys can't remember it now. Alright so LDL greater than 190 so these folks get a

69
0:06:32,340000 --> 0:06:36,820000
high intensity statin patients with diabetes you know they're in the

70
0:06:36,820000 --> 0:06:40,060000
benefit group and then that kind of primary prevention that they don't fit

71
0:06:40,060000 --> 0:06:45,780000
in some of these other risk categories but have an elevated risk. Also you know

72
0:06:45,780000 --> 0:06:49,460000
this kind of brought this goals versus threshold so you know our goal

73
0:06:49,460000 --> 0:06:53,820000
treatment this this percentage of LDL response that we want to see and then

74
0:06:53,820000 --> 0:06:59,980000
threshold being the LDL value where you want to consider starting treatment. So

75
0:06:59,980000 --> 0:07:06,300000
likely you've all seen this diagram here but these are primary

76
0:07:06,300000 --> 0:07:11,140000
prevention folks you know started here we know that those those folks that we

77
0:07:11,140000 --> 0:07:14,980000
talked about with the statin benefit groups they're gonna get statins and

78
0:07:14,980000 --> 0:07:21,500000
really once again with these these newer recommendations it brings forward a

79
0:07:21,500000 --> 0:07:25,900000
lot of thoughts and discussion around this risk assessment with your patients

80
0:07:25,900000 --> 0:07:29,260000
you know understanding their risk talking with them about the risk and then

81
0:07:29,300000 --> 0:07:34,220000
this shared decision making. So really in the primary prevention I think where

82
0:07:34,220000 --> 0:07:38,460000
things you know get really interesting is that kind of borderline or intermediate

83
0:07:38,460000 --> 0:07:43,980000
risk there at the bottom so these folks that maybe don't fully or clearly fall

84
0:07:43,980000 --> 0:07:50,780000
into one of these these benefit groups it's that you know emphasis to go through

85
0:07:50,780000 --> 0:07:56,060000
their risk and talk to them. So the first thing is you know we start to see

86
0:07:56,060000 --> 0:07:59,740000
these risk enhancers and and I think the reason that you know it's important

87
0:07:59,740000 --> 0:08:02,740000
that we even talk about these guidelines as we go forward because all the other

88
0:08:02,740000 --> 0:08:08,300000
recommendations and trials will go through the risk assessment and it'll

89
0:08:08,300000 --> 0:08:14,020000
play into further you know every kind of further document or bulbs around these

90
0:08:14,020000 --> 0:08:19,780000
similar concepts. So risk enhancers this is history of premature ASVD we have

91
0:08:19,780000 --> 0:08:25,260000
the conditions listed here so these would be you know if they're kind of on

92
0:08:25,300000 --> 0:08:30,700000
that borderline or intermediate are there other conditions or factors that

93
0:08:30,700000 --> 0:08:34,900000
we want to consider that would maybe push us towards the treatment option and

94
0:08:34,900000 --> 0:08:40,460000
then you know not only pushing towards the treatment option but also thinking

95
0:08:40,460000 --> 0:08:45,940000
about intensifying treatment and then so the conditions and then lipid biomarkers

96
0:08:45,940000 --> 0:08:52,140000
so we start to see more evidence and recommendations around these other

97
0:08:52,140000 --> 0:08:58,380000
advanced lipid testing LPA is getting a lot of attention and different things

98
0:08:58,380000 --> 0:09:04,580000
for us to consider. From a secondary prevention standpoint you know we

99
0:09:04,580000 --> 0:09:09,620000
start to see this shift from you know just just this high risk to then these

100
0:09:09,620000 --> 0:09:15,980000
more like very high or extreme risk type categories so in the 2018 guideline you

101
0:09:15,980000 --> 0:09:20,860000
know there's a split there with very high risk patients so you know ASVD you get

102
0:09:20,900000 --> 0:09:26,180000
a stand sure high intensity but then these recommendations this is where kind

103
0:09:26,180000 --> 0:09:31,260000
of that goal and the threshold starts to come in play of you know if the

104
0:09:31,260000 --> 0:09:37,380000
patients on this maximally tolerated statin LDL still above 70 that's when

105
0:09:37,380000 --> 0:09:42,460000
you might want to start considering adding another agent. A ZEMI gets the

106
0:09:42,460000 --> 0:09:47,460000
get some preference in these these guidelines and then you know PCSK9 would

107
0:09:47,460000 --> 0:09:53,940000
be the next option. So very high risk but then once again what really

108
0:09:53,940000 --> 0:09:58,540000
defines very high risk and it's listed up here but it's the history of these

109
0:09:58,540000 --> 0:10:05,460000
major ASVD events so multiple ASVD events at the top or one ASVD

110
0:10:05,460000 --> 0:10:12,180000
ASVD event and multiple high risk conditions so these once again these

111
0:10:12,180000 --> 0:10:16,740000
similar concepts so you know the the the European guidelines that we'll talk

112
0:10:16,740000 --> 0:10:20,300000
about the end of the knowledge you got in lines everyone might have some

113
0:10:20,300000 --> 0:10:28,020000
slightly differences on you know their exact way that they define risk but for

114
0:10:28,020000 --> 0:10:32,100000
the most part these are these are pretty consistent of you know how we look at

115
0:10:32,100000 --> 0:10:39,260000
who's who are these more kind of extreme or very high risk patients. So I won't

116
0:10:39,260000 --> 0:10:43,860000
take too much time talking about the older trials but you know the improvement

117
0:10:43,860000 --> 0:10:48,460000
before I think it's important to bring these up just as we kind of tell the

118
0:10:48,460000 --> 0:10:57,060000
story or this picture of how these these look because these trials then gave a

119
0:10:57,060000 --> 0:11:04,500000
you know it's kind of a strong influence in the 2018 guideline and then you know

120
0:11:04,500000 --> 0:11:09,700000
continue continue from there. Joel will talk a little bit about these trials too

121
0:11:09,700000 --> 0:11:14,100000
but I wanted to make sure that we at least touch on them here you know

122
0:11:14,100000 --> 0:11:18,620000
improve it I'm sure like I said many of you are familiar with it but randomized

123
0:11:18,620000 --> 0:11:23,580000
trial good patient population high-risk patients you know the important things

124
0:11:23,580000 --> 0:11:27,460000
to consider there was you know the patients treated with Simba Stan or Simba

125
0:11:27,460000 --> 0:11:33,500000
Zemod the Zemodomide group showed an additional kind of cardiovascular

126
0:11:33,500000 --> 0:11:40,260000
benefit and you know the things to think about here are the mean LDL achieved by

127
0:11:40,260000 --> 0:11:47,860000
the group the Zemodomide Simba Stan group was 53 so that that'll come back up and

128
0:11:47,860000 --> 0:11:54,200000
in future kind of discussions or thoughts on slides and then even in the age sub

129
0:11:54,200000 --> 0:11:59,500000
group so they there were subgroups of grade in 65 and subgroup of grade in 75

130
0:11:59,500000 --> 0:12:05,180000
and the benefit persisted was even more pronounced in that that older

131
0:12:05,180000 --> 0:12:15,500000
population. Similar with on the other side with our PCSK9 trial large randomized

132
0:12:15,500000 --> 0:12:23,420000
controlled trial good endpoints once again additional benefit from the PCSK9

133
0:12:23,420000 --> 0:12:30,020000
with a median LDL of 30 in this population so very low LDL achieved with

134
0:12:30,020000 --> 0:12:35,820000
additional cardiovascular benefit and you know no significant safety concerns and

135
0:12:35,820000 --> 0:12:40,540000
once again they didn't have the the greater than 75 but the greater than 65

136
0:12:40,540000 --> 0:12:46,460000
subgroup did carry and show the the additional benefit of kind of having

137
0:12:46,460000 --> 0:12:51,780000
this non-stand option or this this treatment on top of stan.

138
0:12:51,940000 --> 0:12:58,980000
Okay so this is the same question that you guys already answered but kind of a

139
0:12:58,980000 --> 0:13:07,540000
chance to close it out and go through our final recommendation.

140
0:13:08,540000 --> 0:13:14,140000
All right so majority of the group is sticking with the LDL grade or the

141
0:13:14,140000 --> 0:13:19,380000
LDL C reduction of grade in 50% LDL threshold of grade in 70 so yeah you're

142
0:13:19,380000 --> 0:13:25,220000
right that's that's our kind of best our most appropriate answer based on the

143
0:13:25,220000 --> 0:13:34,020000
guideline recommendations and then the most appropriate intervention so another

144
0:13:34,020000 --> 0:13:37,940000
chance to to revisit this one.

145
0:13:38,820000 --> 0:13:43,500000
All right is Edamite there we go we got a group of lipid experts in here this is

146
0:13:43,500000 --> 0:13:50,340000
great guys. So yeah the you know the guidelines you're you're right on target

147
0:13:50,340000 --> 0:13:56,300000
with the thresholds is that am I so then we'll move forward to our you know

148
0:13:56,300000 --> 0:14:00,460000
touching on the other guidelines so you know we talked about the the other

149
0:14:00,460000 --> 0:14:04,380000
guidelines having more intensive recommendations for these high-risk

150
0:14:04,380000 --> 0:14:09,420000
patients and with the European guidelines we do start to see that so you

151
0:14:09,420000 --> 0:14:13,780000
know the high risk is similar to what we've seen but they they start categories

152
0:14:13,780000 --> 0:14:20,500000
in this very high risk of you know a goal of less than 55 and some of that goes

153
0:14:20,500000 --> 0:14:23,660000
back to when talked about the improvement trial so that that treatment group

154
0:14:23,660000 --> 0:14:31,900000
breached a the mean LDL of 53 so this goal of 55 potentially then it's kind of

155
0:14:31,900000 --> 0:14:37,660000
where that comes from is some of that coincides with that that trial and then

156
0:14:37,660000 --> 0:14:42,620000
at the bottom there with the the Fourier trial that treatment group with a median

157
0:14:42,620000 --> 0:14:47,940000
less than 30 the European guidelines suggest that you know if there's been a

158
0:14:47,940000 --> 0:14:53,460000
second cardiovascular event within two years an LDL of less than 40 may be

159
0:14:53,460000 --> 0:14:58,300000
considered so we're seeing pretty strong recommendations for less than 55 for

160
0:14:58,300000 --> 0:15:03,060000
these very high risk and then even potentially less than 40 for some of these

161
0:15:03,540000 --> 0:15:10,100000
folks as well. Older adults recommendations provided pretty pretty consistent with

162
0:15:10,100000 --> 0:15:14,780000
what we've seen from other guidelines but you know this this idea to you know if

163
0:15:14,780000 --> 0:15:18,980000
the patient has AS CBD you know recommend to treat older people and

164
0:15:18,980000 --> 0:15:24,540000
younger people the same approach from a primary prevention standpoint that's

165
0:15:24,540000 --> 0:15:32,340000
where that less than 75 kind of stays consistent with the other guidelines and

166
0:15:32,340000 --> 0:15:38,700000
the the first two in the last one or class one recommendations and then the

167
0:15:38,700000 --> 0:15:43,420000
third one is the only kind of class two of the ones on here but that's where

168
0:15:43,420000 --> 0:15:48,740000
it's kind of that primary prevention if they're older than 75 it's a you know you

169
0:15:48,740000 --> 0:15:55,460000
might consider based based at their their risk level. Then with our

170
0:15:55,460000 --> 0:16:00,220000
endocrinology guidelines so you know main thing to point out here so it's

171
0:16:00,260000 --> 0:16:06,020000
just another kind of consensus document supporting these lower LDL

172
0:16:06,020000 --> 0:16:11,460000
threshold goals and then other lipid lipid kind of secondary targets provided as

173
0:16:11,460000 --> 0:16:19,020000
well. Okay so we have the 2018 guidelines the we see these other you know

174
0:16:19,020000 --> 0:16:23,340000
organizations put out updates so then you know there's clearly a need for on the

175
0:16:23,340000 --> 0:16:28,620000
ACC side to come up with with kind of better support of what to do we have more

176
0:16:28,660000 --> 0:16:33,380000
trials coming out and you know thinking about what patient populations need

177
0:16:33,380000 --> 0:16:38,100000
newer statins you know what are the best situations and what should be

178
0:16:38,100000 --> 0:16:43,700000
considered and what order. So not going through the extensive document of

179
0:16:43,700000 --> 0:16:47,220000
course but really you know some of the biggest differences once again it's

180
0:16:47,220000 --> 0:16:50,180000
these more of the secondary prevention because secondary

181
0:16:50,180000 --> 0:16:55,940000
prevention is where we see these newer or lower goals than traditionally we've

182
0:16:55,980000 --> 0:17:02,260000
seen but so so no surprise from a guideline document these kind of high

183
0:17:02,260000 --> 0:17:07,380000
risk but not very high risk secondary prevention patients LDL reduction of

184
0:17:07,380000 --> 0:17:12,780000
greater than 50 percent LDL less than 70 there's non HDL of 100 less than 100

185
0:17:12,780000 --> 0:17:18,300000
provided so need to be on a maximally tolerated statin we're going to talk

186
0:17:18,300000 --> 0:17:22,220000
about lifestyle all these important things to to address and then

187
0:17:22,220000 --> 0:17:27,900000
consideration for the non stands is provided now you know in Joel's section

188
0:17:27,900000 --> 0:17:32,860000
he's gonna he's gonna go much more into to the trials of these these different

189
0:17:32,860000 --> 0:17:37,860000
options because even when this so when this document came out the Bempadoke

190
0:17:37,860000 --> 0:17:41,900000
acid and glycerin so they didn't have some of the outcomes trials or they didn't

191
0:17:41,900000 --> 0:17:45,540000
have the outcomes trials that that are available now so even at time when this

192
0:17:45,540000 --> 0:17:51,680000
this decision pathway document came out there was more preference towards

193
0:17:51,680000 --> 0:17:55,720000
is edamite in the PCSK9 inhibitors because they had the best outcomes

194
0:17:55,720000 --> 0:18:02,080000
available at the at the time the very high risk patients so they're coming in

195
0:18:02,080000 --> 0:18:09,440000
line with with these other kind of shift that we see so LDL less than 55 so much

196
0:18:09,440000 --> 0:18:14,520000
more aggressive kind of treatment threshold than we've seen in the past

197
0:18:14,520000 --> 0:18:21,680000
but you know large large support for to go to these lower lower goals so this

198
0:18:21,680000 --> 0:18:26,560000
slide here is just to try to bring together some of the the decision pathway

199
0:18:26,560000 --> 0:18:32,840000
document you know when I was looking at the the LDL see the threshold I guess at

200
0:18:32,840000 --> 0:18:35,840000
times it's probably confusing if it's supposed to be less than or greater than

201
0:18:35,840000 --> 0:18:40,480000
depending on what you're looking at but you know the the greater than would be

202
0:18:40,480000 --> 0:18:44,320000
if it's above it's above these levels that's when we start thinking about do we

203
0:18:44,320000 --> 0:18:49,720000
need to add a non-stand option so the biggest difference of course pointing out

204
0:18:49,720000 --> 0:18:55,600000
all these all these different categories but that greater than 55 threshold is

205
0:18:55,600000 --> 0:19:00,520000
when we can start really considering these non-stand options to to reach

206
0:19:00,520000 --> 0:19:06,840000
these lower levels all right so one more question and then we'll transition

207
0:19:06,840000 --> 0:19:11,200000
back to goal but really coming back to this patient case so so we answered from

208
0:19:11,200000 --> 0:19:17,080000
the perspective of the 2018 guidelines but if we think about the same patient

209
0:19:17,080000 --> 0:19:28,560000
in their target treatment from the 2022 pathway what do we think do our do our

210
0:19:28,640000 --> 0:19:38,920000
recommendations stay the same or different based on these all right so

211
0:19:38,920000 --> 0:19:44,280000
greater than 50% LDL greater than 55 yep that's that's where these newer

212
0:19:44,280000 --> 0:19:49,200000
recommendations are pushing us so that that's where we're at from a treatment

213
0:19:49,200000 --> 0:19:53,480000
approach you know I'll transition over to Joel to really get into the the trial

214
0:19:53,480000 --> 0:20:00,440000
data of you know all the support behind us so you guys will see me later but

215
0:20:00,440000 --> 0:20:03,360000
Canada over Joel

216
0:20:08,880000 --> 0:20:13,880000
thanks Matt so now that we kind of laid the framework for kind of where we've

217
0:20:13,880000 --> 0:20:18,320000
come over the last number of years with various guidelines across the US and

218
0:20:18,320000 --> 0:20:22,560000
internationally we're gonna delve into some of the trials that drove those

219
0:20:22,600000 --> 0:20:27,840000
changes as well as some newer literature that wasn't included in the expert

220
0:20:27,840000 --> 0:20:34,840000
consensus decision pathway that was released last year all right so Matt

221
0:20:34,840000 --> 0:20:38,760000
already covered this briefly but just wanted to kind of revisit this because

222
0:20:38,760000 --> 0:20:42,760000
this is one of the primary trials that kind of drove that change that we saw

223
0:20:42,760000 --> 0:20:47,480000
from the European society guidelines the East guidelines as well as the new

224
0:20:47,480000 --> 0:20:53,440000
consensus pathway of that 55 LDL mark as you can see here since the

225
0:20:53,440000 --> 0:20:57,680000
improved trial when you combined azetamite and Simba statin they got that

226
0:20:57,680000 --> 0:21:03,160000
group into to the 53 range the one thing that I take away from this trial is

227
0:21:03,160000 --> 0:21:07,600000
that all these patients are very high risk and so if you look at the event

228
0:21:07,600000 --> 0:21:12,720000
rates in this trial whether they got statin monotherapy or azetamite

229
0:21:12,720000 --> 0:21:17,440000
post- statin a third of patients had another cardiovascular event within seven

230
0:21:17,440000 --> 0:21:21,640000
years in the study and so I think it further reiterates or highlights the

231
0:21:21,640000 --> 0:21:25,600000
point that we probably do need to be more aggressive in this very high-risk

232
0:21:25,600000 --> 0:21:31,800000
patient population and then the other study that was included in the 2018

233
0:21:31,800000 --> 0:21:37,520000
guidelines was for EA and so Matt already highlighted this study briefly but did

234
0:21:37,520000 --> 0:21:41,280000
want to kind of revisit and touch on this because I think this highlights that

235
0:21:41,520000 --> 0:21:45,920000
we've seen now trials and we'll cover a few more trials that getting patients

236
0:21:45,920000 --> 0:21:52,800000
under an LDL of 40 has proven to be safe in many instances and so we'll talk

237
0:21:52,800000 --> 0:21:58,160000
about the safety issues as I go through some of the other trials and evaluating

238
0:21:58,160000 --> 0:22:03,400000
that of is there a too low LDL mark to get to but in this study they got

239
0:22:03,400000 --> 0:22:09,800000
patients down to 30 on on average and as you can see here had a 15% relative risk

240
0:22:09,800000 --> 0:22:15,040000
reduction of cardiovascular events and so to look at the landscape of this

241
0:22:15,040000 --> 0:22:19,400000
we're gonna kind of run through some statin data but usually most of the

242
0:22:19,400000 --> 0:22:26,440000
focus will be on statin plus these other agents and so we'll talk about azetamive

243
0:22:26,440000 --> 0:22:30,920000
briefly talk about bile acids of questions focus on some of the newer

244
0:22:30,920000 --> 0:22:35,680000
trial data with PCSK9 inhibitors and some of the longitudinal open-label data

245
0:22:35,840000 --> 0:22:39,720000
that's looked at some of the safety parameters and then highlight some of

246
0:22:39,720000 --> 0:22:43,760000
the ongoing as well as concluded studies for both but but also acid and

247
0:22:43,760000 --> 0:22:48,680000
cluster and so I think we've seen a large growth in the last few years of

248
0:22:48,680000 --> 0:22:53,880000
different approaches and so clearly we've seen multiple PCSK9 inhibitor trials

249
0:22:53,880000 --> 0:22:57,520000
that I'll cover today we've now seen and cluster and come into play as a

250
0:22:57,520000 --> 0:23:02,680000
potential means to lower LDL pretty dramatically as well and then bimpedoic

251
0:23:02,680000 --> 0:23:06,560000
acid that was just approved a couple years ago and so we've added a number

252
0:23:06,560000 --> 0:23:10,600000
of agents that weren't necessarily available or we didn't have outcome

253
0:23:10,600000 --> 0:23:15,240000
trial data for all of these when some of these guidance documents were published

254
0:23:15,240000 --> 0:23:20,280000
so we're gonna jump into a patient case and then we'll kind of go back to some

255
0:23:20,280000 --> 0:23:25,160000
of the literature so we have a 50 year old male with a past medical history of

256
0:23:25,160000 --> 0:23:30,960000
a number of cardiovascular risk factors had an MI four years ago and also had a

257
0:23:31 --> 0:23:35,920000
stroke two years ago and so fits into that very high risk bucket that we talked

258
0:23:35,920000 --> 0:23:39,920000
about in the first part of the presentation as you can see here is on

259
0:23:39,920000 --> 0:23:44,040000
multiple cholesterol lowering agents so is on Rasou the statin and azetamide and

260
0:23:44,040000 --> 0:23:55,320000
has an LDL with the recent lipid panel of 80 so according to the 2022 expert

261
0:23:55,320000 --> 0:24:00,640000
consensus decision pathway that the mat covered what would you say is the

262
0:24:00,640000 --> 0:24:05,680000
LDL reduction goal or target as well as with that threshold would be for this

263
0:24:05,680000 --> 0:24:11,400000
patient all right so looks like most people are getting the theme of our

264
0:24:11,400000 --> 0:24:16,560000
talk today and in alignment with our with our title as well so we'll revisit

265
0:24:16,560000 --> 0:24:21,360000
this and kind of what additional data kind of drove some of these kind of

266
0:24:21,360000 --> 0:24:27,800000
thresholds that are getting more and more aggressive all right how about if you

267
0:24:27,800000 --> 0:24:33,960000
were to look at the European guidelines in this patient looks like we got a

268
0:24:33,960000 --> 0:24:38
mix between at least less than 55 but potentially less than 40 and so what

269
0:24:38 --> 0:24:42,760000
kind of revisit some of that as the European guidelines were the ones that

270
0:24:42,760000 --> 0:24:46,520000
first highlighted that if you've had multiple events and then more recent

271
0:24:46,520000 --> 0:24:50
events within the last two years you could be more aggressive potentially and

272
0:24:50 --> 0:24:57,680000
target that less than 40 all right and then from a treatment standpoint what

273
0:24:57,720000 --> 0:25:02,800000
would you want to do for this patient based on the most recent ACC consensus

274
0:25:02,800000 --> 0:25:13,400000
decision pathway so looks like majority are choosing PCSK9 inhibitor option and

275
0:25:13,400000 --> 0:25:17,760000
so we'll kind of come back to that over the next few slides but one of the

276
0:25:17,760000 --> 0:25:21,880000
things that we talked about is that we do now have some more outcome data with

277
0:25:21,880000 --> 0:25:25,920000
BIMPADOIC acid and so that has kind of probably does need to be adjusted in

278
0:25:25,960000 --> 0:25:31,200000
the consensus pathway moving forward or at least referencing the clinical

279
0:25:31,200000 --> 0:25:34,800000
trial data that we've seen and so I'll go through some of that since that

280
0:25:34,800000 --> 0:25:40,280000
wasn't necessarily included in the in the document from 2022 but as you can see

281
0:25:40,280000 --> 0:25:44,600000
here this person still has a ways to go to get to their LDL threshold whether

282
0:25:44,600000 --> 0:25:51,040000
you say it's less than 55 or less than 40 and so they probably need to be on a

283
0:25:51,040000 --> 0:25:57,720000
PCSK9 inhibitor to get that amount of LDL lowering. So one of the big questions

284
0:25:57,720000 --> 0:26:03,440000
that's come up from the literature is is it safe to lower LDL values this

285
0:26:03,440000 --> 0:26:07,800000
aggressively in this patient population so we know for many many years we've

286
0:26:07,800000 --> 0:26:13,680000
seen multiple meta analyses as it relates to the new new onset diabetes and kind

287
0:26:13,680000 --> 0:26:19,040000
of that association with statins and does this hold true with other therapies was

288
0:26:19,120000 --> 0:26:24,120000
one question that we'll try to go through today in a meta analysis that was done.

289
0:26:24,120000 --> 0:26:29,760000
Additionally one of the concerns or potential concerns was a potential

290
0:26:29,760000 --> 0:26:33,600000
increase risk for hemorrhagic stroke as you decreased LDL pretty dramatically

291
0:26:33,600000 --> 0:26:38,240000
and so we'll talk about what the trial data looks like when you look at very

292
0:26:38,240000 --> 0:26:43,760000
aggressive LDL lowering less than 40 and then there was some concern that they

293
0:26:43,760000 --> 0:26:47,680000
wanted to evaluate was this increase risk for cataracts in this one analysis so

294
0:26:47,680000 --> 0:26:51,720000
they basically looked at reduction in cardiovascular events as well as safety

295
0:26:51,720000 --> 0:26:59,160000
outcomes in this analysis that I'll review. So this was actually just

296
0:26:59,160000 --> 0:27:02,760000
published earlier this year so as a meta analysis that basically looked at

297
0:27:02,760000 --> 0:27:06,800000
possible association with adverse events and specifically those ones that I

298
0:27:06,800000 --> 0:27:10,960000
mentioned but they did look at a few other outcomes as well and they specifically

299
0:27:10,960000 --> 0:27:16,960000
used a cut point of an LDL less than 40 or not and so that was their driver.

300
0:27:16,960000 --> 0:27:22,880000
They did only pull literature into 2021 so they did not include literature from

301
0:27:22,880000 --> 0:27:27,680000
the last year and a half or so and as I mentioned they looked at that cut point

302
0:27:27,680000 --> 0:27:32,800000
did patients achieve a very low LDL and was there a difference in associated

303
0:27:32,800000 --> 0:27:37,760000
adverse events seen in the trials. So they were able to include 10 different

304
0:27:37,760000 --> 0:27:43,480000
trials in the study almost 40,000 patients in the very low LDL group and

305
0:27:43,480000 --> 0:27:49,960000
about double that in their control arm. The median follow-up was just over two

306
0:27:49,960000 --> 0:27:55,520000
years in these studies and so shorter in nature in this analysis and they looked

307
0:27:55,520000 --> 0:27:59,200000
at a number of primary safety outcomes and so they looked at a composite as well

308
0:27:59,200000 --> 0:28:03,240000
as these individually. As you can see here some of these aligned with those

309
0:28:03,280000 --> 0:28:08,680000
that I previously mentioned especially with new onset diabetes potential

310
0:28:08,680000 --> 0:28:13,480000
hemorrhagic stroke risk all adverse events overall were looked at as well and

311
0:28:13,480000 --> 0:28:19,920000
then they looked at major cardiovascular events in these trials and so when you

312
0:28:19,920000 --> 0:28:24,760000
look at this analysis there actually was no significant signal or safety concern

313
0:28:24,760000 --> 0:28:30,480000
that was identified and so whether you looked at non-CD-deaf in the control

314
0:28:30,520000 --> 0:28:37,840000
arm versus the LDL less than 40 arm none of these odds ratios actually are all

315
0:28:37,840000 --> 0:28:42,400000
these odds ratios cross one and so none of them are actually significant. When you

316
0:28:42,400000 --> 0:28:47,360000
looked at the overall composite of adverse events there really wasn't any

317
0:28:47,360000 --> 0:28:51,720000
difference between the two arms as well and so some of this publication is

318
0:28:51,720000 --> 0:28:55,680000
reassuring as we're moving in this direction to be more aggressive with

319
0:28:55,840000 --> 0:29:01,160000
lipoplurring that we haven't seen kind of this signal that there is increased

320
0:29:01,160000 --> 0:29:05,800000
risk. Hemorrhagic stroke as mentioned before is one of those potential

321
0:29:05,800000 --> 0:29:11,480000
concerns that we were looking at also showed no difference. When you looked at

322
0:29:11,480000 --> 0:29:16,640000
new onset diabetes in this analysis there was no difference but we know that

323
0:29:16,640000 --> 0:29:20,360000
there still is literature out there that shows that there is was stand therapy at

324
0:29:20,360000 --> 0:29:25,440000
least some association with new onset diabetes but most analyses demonstrate

325
0:29:25,440000 --> 0:29:30,360000
that the risk lowering from a cardiovascular disease standpoint often

326
0:29:30,360000 --> 0:29:35,720000
outweighs that potential risk from a glycemia standpoint. Additionally there

327
0:29:35,720000 --> 0:29:40,600000
was no signal for neurocognitive disorders or muscle disorders in

328
0:29:40,600000 --> 0:29:45,160000
getting this very low LDL so overall the big takeaway from this analysis was that

329
0:29:45,160000 --> 0:29:49,800000
we haven't seen and the at least from the studies that were analyzed those 10

330
0:29:49,800000 --> 0:29:55,160000
trials any signal for concern of getting patients to a pretty lower

331
0:29:55,160000 --> 0:30:02,840000
aggressive LDL. When you looked at cardiovascular outcomes in this analysis

332
0:30:02,840000 --> 0:30:06,120000
so they looked at the whole all the safety concerns or potential safety

333
0:30:06,120000 --> 0:30:10,440000
concerns that I mentioned when you looked at their primary composite endpoint and

334
0:30:10,440000 --> 0:30:14,280000
across trials this was different so some trials it was your traditional three-point

335
0:30:14,360000 --> 0:30:20,440000
mace so CVDestroken MI which is that second odds ratio there or the primary

336
0:30:20,440000 --> 0:30:25,560000
composite sometimes was four-point mace five-point mace in these studies and so

337
0:30:25,560000 --> 0:30:31,280000
one thing that was identified was getting to very low or aggressive LDL is less

338
0:30:31,280000 --> 0:30:36,200000
than 40 actually demonstrated a vent lowering from a cardiovascular disease

339
0:30:36,200000 --> 0:30:40,080000
standpoint so there was this positive signal of a vent lowering and really

340
0:30:40,160000 --> 0:30:46,800000
not a signal from a safety standpoint in these in these trials.

341
0:30:49,600000 --> 0:30:55,920000
So the HA recently put out this scientific statement a brow aggressive

342
0:30:55,920000 --> 0:31:00,720000
LDL lowering and the brain and potential impact of risk for dimension hemorrhagic

343
0:31:00,720000 --> 0:31:05,600000
stroke. A couple things that they highlighted in this scientific statement

344
0:31:05,600000 --> 0:31:10,240000
that was published earlier this year was identifying that the risk of hemorrhagic

345
0:31:10,240000 --> 0:31:15,680000
stroke associated with statin therapy in patients without a history of a cerebral

346
0:31:15,680000 --> 0:31:20,400000
vascular disease a baseline was not significant and so they didn't identify

347
0:31:20,400000 --> 0:31:24,920000
any concern there when they looked at a number of different trials so they looked

348
0:31:24,920000 --> 0:31:28,720000
at prospective studies they looked at some retrospective analysis some case

349
0:31:28,720000 --> 0:31:34,960000
control studies as well and they didn't really see that association. They further

350
0:31:34,960000 --> 0:31:38,800000
went on to say that achieving very low levels of LDL does not increase your

351
0:31:38,800000 --> 0:31:42,320000
risk of hemorrhagic stroke so this statement aligns with that meta-analysis

352
0:31:42,320000 --> 0:31:46,840000
that I just presented that the literature and trial data that's been analyzed so

353
0:31:46,840000 --> 0:31:51,600000
far doesn't really highlight or indicate that this should be kind of a major

354
0:31:51,600000 --> 0:31:58,560000
concern moving forward as we as we get to very aggressive LDLs.

355
0:31:58,560000 --> 0:32:03,240000
This was a study out of Europe that was published earlier this year and I

356
0:32:03,280000 --> 0:32:09
highlight this because this is some of the data that has shown gaps and highlighted

357
0:32:09 --> 0:32:16,680000
from the standpoint we know that ESC in a number of years ago now so in 2019 was

358
0:32:16,680000 --> 0:32:22,040000
more aggressive with their LDL lowering targets and so looking at this was that

359
0:32:22,040000 --> 0:32:26,840000
adopted and so we know when we've seen lots of presentations at this meeting of

360
0:32:26,840000 --> 0:32:30,320000
it takes many many years before we oftentimes see guidelines adopted in

361
0:32:30,360000 --> 0:32:35,480000
practice and so this is just one analysis of data from Santorini and so

362
0:32:35,480000 --> 0:32:40,840000
basically an observational study but they looked at just over 9,000 patients

363
0:32:40,840000 --> 0:32:48,440000
and looked at prescribing practices once those guidelines were released and it

364
0:32:48,440000 --> 0:32:53,720000
highlighted that many patients were identified as very high-risk so about

365
0:32:53,720000 --> 0:32:57,560000
three quarters of patients in this population that they looked at were

366
0:32:57,600000 --> 0:33:01,640000
identified as very high-risk so you would be pushing and targeting for at least

367
0:33:01,640000 --> 0:33:08,480000
an LDLs than 55 but when you looked at what patients actually received about

368
0:33:08,480000 --> 0:33:14
90% were just on monotherapy with statins and we know that most of the time to

369
0:33:14 --> 0:33:18,720000
get to these very low LDL values were generally not able to do that with just

370
0:33:18,720000 --> 0:33:23,480000
monotherapy with one agent and so there was about a quarter of patients that were

371
0:33:23,520000 --> 0:33:29
on combination therapy of statins plus azetamide but it further highlights the

372
0:33:29 --> 0:33:35
need to educate and disseminate as we get some of these newer trials out there

373
0:33:35 --> 0:33:39,600000
as well as these consensus documents to highlight an opportunity that

374
0:33:39,600000 --> 0:33:43,840000
specially pharmacists can apply in the interdisciplinary team to help optimize

375
0:33:43,840000 --> 0:33:50,080000
some of these therapies. Alright so next we're going to jump into some of the other

376
0:33:50,120000 --> 0:33:56,520000
trial data that's looked at very aggressive or more pronounced LDL lowering

377
0:33:56,520000 --> 0:34:00,840000
and so azetamide is the first one I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it

378
0:34:00,840000 --> 0:34:04,720000
on improvement because we've already talked about that there are a few other

379
0:34:04,720000 --> 0:34:10
studies that have looked at combination therapy this trial specifically looked

380
0:34:10 --> 0:34:15,200000
at patients with aortic stenosis or C's was published a number of years ago and

381
0:34:15,200000 --> 0:34:19,760000
one of the key things was that in that study they did not necessarily demonstrate

382
0:34:19,760000 --> 0:34:24,240000
a lower of events in that population but demonstrated that safely you could

383
0:34:24,240000 --> 0:34:32,200000
get patients down into a low LDL range. Sharp was a study that was done over a

384
0:34:32,200000 --> 0:34:36,200000
decade ago and looked at combination therapy and getting to more aggressive

385
0:34:36,200000 --> 0:34:39,600000
lowering and so this was a study that looked at our chronic kidney disease

386
0:34:39,600000 --> 0:34:43,680000
population it was unique from the standpoint of included about one-third

387
0:34:43,680000 --> 0:34:48,640000
of patients that were dialysis patients and then two-thirds were predialysis

388
0:34:48,640000 --> 0:34:53,680000
patients when you looked at the data overall they got patients that were on

389
0:34:53,680000 --> 0:34:59,080000
combination that is that amide sima statin to quite a bit of a reduction so

390
0:34:59,080000 --> 0:35:04,960000
they got patients down to around an LDL of 75 and a little over a 50% LDL

391
0:35:04,960000 --> 0:35:10,120000
reduction with that combination group when you looked at the outcomes there was a

392
0:35:10,120000 --> 0:35:13,160000
statistical difference between the outcomes and so an absolute risk

393
0:35:13,160000 --> 0:35:17,480000
difference of 2.1 and so kind of fits into that ballpark of a number needed

394
0:35:17,520000 --> 0:35:22,720000
treated about 50 and so demonstrated benefit the unique thing about this

395
0:35:22,720000 --> 0:35:27,440000
trial was that that benefit was driven by predialysis CKD and so one of the

396
0:35:27,440000 --> 0:35:31,960000
things we know in managing lipids in that population is that there have been

397
0:35:31,960000 --> 0:35:36,040000
multiple trials that have looked at treating patients that are on hemodialysis

398
0:35:36,040000 --> 0:35:40,480000
for statin therapy if they have established a CDD and those haven't

399
0:35:40,480000 --> 0:35:45,320000
really panned out to demonstrate lower cardiovascular events where the

400
0:35:45,360000 --> 0:35:52,940000
predialysis CKD population has demonstrated those benefits the next

401
0:35:52,940000 --> 0:35:56,760000
trial from a zetamite standpoint that I'm going to talk about is the racing

402
0:35:56,760000 --> 0:36:05,300000
trial so this is a study of just under 4,000 patients with AS CBD a wide age

403
0:36:05,300000 --> 0:36:11,480000
range here as you can see and with LDLs a baseline less than 70 so high-risk

404
0:36:11,480000 --> 0:36:18,480000
population but already already treated to a fairly aggressive LDL mark when they

405
0:36:18,480000 --> 0:36:23,720000
evaluated patients that compared to a Statton monotherapy at a high-intensity

406
0:36:23,720000 --> 0:36:30,360000
statin dose versus a zetamite and a zetamite at a moderate intensity statin

407
0:36:30,360000 --> 0:36:35,240000
dose and as you can see here in the trial there actually wasn't a difference

408
0:36:35,240000 --> 0:36:38,600000
when they looked at the primary cardiovascular endpoint which was CV

409
0:36:38,680000 --> 0:36:43,640000
death and my hospitalization for CV events and revascularizations as well as

410
0:36:43,640000 --> 0:36:47,120000
non-fatal stroke there wasn't a statistical difference between the two

411
0:36:47,120000 --> 0:36:51,080000
groups but further highlighted that with combination therapy you could get

412
0:36:51,080000 --> 0:36:55,960000
patients down to a more aggressive LDL and they got into the 50 range there so

413
0:36:55,960000 --> 0:37:02,720000
further data to continue to support this approach that we probably need to be

414
0:37:02,720000 --> 0:37:07,520000
for sure targeting this less than 55 for most patients that are considered

415
0:37:07,520000 --> 0:37:11,040000
very high-risk and maybe even more aggressive and those that have had

416
0:37:11,040000 --> 0:37:18,520000
multiple events they did a post hoc analysis of this study as well and so

417
0:37:18,520000 --> 0:37:22,160000
they looked at those that are very high-risk versus those that were not very

418
0:37:22,160000 --> 0:37:28,680000
high-risk and they defined that based on ACC, AHA, criteria and when you looked at

419
0:37:28,680000 --> 0:37:34,640000
those the very high-risk population actually had the primary outcome occur

420
0:37:34,720000 --> 0:37:40,040000
more frequently and so it supported the hypothesis that these patients that are

421
0:37:40,040000 --> 0:37:44,360000
very high-risk probably needed to be treated to an even more aggressive LDL

422
0:37:44,360000 --> 0:37:49,880000
target to see the benefits because of their risk at baseline and so that was

423
0:37:49,880000 --> 0:37:55,480000
one unique finding that they they found from the trial itself. So we covered a

424
0:37:55,480000 --> 0:37:59,800000
lot about statins plus azetamive and we're gonna kind of pivot now and come

425
0:37:59,840000 --> 0:38:05,200000
back to PCSK9 inhibitors and then round out with a few other therapy

426
0:38:05,200000 --> 0:38:12,240000
options before turning it back over to Matt in about 25 minutes or so. So we

427
0:38:12,240000 --> 0:38:15,160000
already talked about Fourier and so I'm not going to revisit this but included

428
0:38:15,160000 --> 0:38:20
it here just for completeness knowing that this was a driver for both safety as

429
0:38:20 --> 0:38:24,320000
well as efficacy that we could lower patients aggressively that were already

430
0:38:24,320000 --> 0:38:29,720000
on maximum tolerated statin therapies in a high-risk AS CBD population and get to

431
0:38:29,720000 --> 0:38:37,520000
very low goals and see a bit more in with that. Then we had odyssey outcomes

432
0:38:37,520000 --> 0:38:43,400000
with allerocumab and so this study pretty similar patient population large

433
0:38:43,400000 --> 0:38:48,680000
studies so just under 20,000 patients that had a recent ACS event. As you can

434
0:38:48,680000 --> 0:38:53,720000
see here these did not necessarily include a lot of older individuals so

435
0:38:53,720000 --> 0:38:59,320000
the mean age in the trial was 59 but patients had an LDL above 70 to get into

436
0:38:59,320000 --> 0:39:03,680000
the trial. As you can see here some of these newer studies are shorter in

437
0:39:03,680000 --> 0:39:08,800000
nature and so median of just under three years for this trial and looked at your

438
0:39:08,800000 --> 0:39:14,840000
traditional a large major cardiovascular of an outcome. As you can see here there

439
0:39:14,840000 --> 0:39:20,400000
was a pretty similar risk relative risk lowering that we saw with the Fourier

440
0:39:20,400000 --> 0:39:26,520000
study with allerocumab. The mean LDL in the trial was was 53 so didn't

441
0:39:26,560000 --> 0:39:30,720000
necessarily get down into that 30 range like we saw in the other trial but

442
0:39:30,720000 --> 0:39:34,760000
further supported that lower is better in this kind of concept that's continuing

443
0:39:34,760000 --> 0:39:43,880000
to funnel into each of these trials. One of the things that's come up since we

444
0:39:43,880000 --> 0:39:47,440000
know that we've had statins on the market so a low of a statin hit the market in

445
0:39:47,440000 --> 0:39:52,800000
1987 so we have decades of experience from a safety as well as efficacy

446
0:39:52,800000 --> 0:39:57,120000
standpoint. Well some of these newer agents we don't have trials that are

447
0:39:57,120000 --> 0:40:01,440000
extensive length and so with the Fourier study they did an open label

448
0:40:01,440000 --> 0:40:05,440000
extension and so they actually followed patients up for an additional five years

449
0:40:05,440000 --> 0:40:10,800000
after the completion of that trial and so is that same cohort of patients and

450
0:40:10,800000 --> 0:40:16,400000
then they basically had just over 6,000 patients that continued in that open

451
0:40:16,400000 --> 0:40:20,760000
label treatment arm and they primarily were looking at whether there was

452
0:40:20,800000 --> 0:40:27,280000
adverse events or any safety concerns that occurred and that follow up. What

453
0:40:27,280000 --> 0:40:30,600000
they were able to see is that patients were still able to maintain a pretty

454
0:40:30,600000 --> 0:40:35,600000
aggressive or low LDL with treatment and so two-thirds of patients actually had

455
0:40:35,600000 --> 0:40:40,840000
an LDL during this whole follow-up period of less than 40 and so kind of

456
0:40:40,840000 --> 0:40:45,720000
getting into that number that we saw from the European Society of Cardiology

457
0:40:45,720000 --> 0:40:50,680000
Guidelines that came out in 2019. The further when you looked at adverse events

458
0:40:50,680000 --> 0:40:54,840000
in this trial they didn't really identify any adverse event similar to some of the

459
0:40:54,840000 --> 0:40:59,720000
other data we had looked at with very aggressive LDL lowering and so really

460
0:40:59,720000 --> 0:41:04,360000
no adverse events difference between treatment and no treatment but as you

461
0:41:04,360000 --> 0:41:08,080000
can see here their primary composite endpoint as they carried that forward

462
0:41:08,080000 --> 0:41:13,080000
and this open label extension still was statistically significant with that

463
0:41:13,240000 --> 0:41:17,560000
major cardiovascular endpoint data as well as when you looked at your kind of

464
0:41:17,560000 --> 0:41:23,840000
traditional three-point mace of CBF MI stroke you saw a 20% relative risk

465
0:41:23,840000 --> 0:41:32,760000
reduction and CBF also showed a signal towards positive outcomes. When they

466
0:41:32,760000 --> 0:41:37,280000
analyzed patients within this they did subanalysis of looking at patients that

467
0:41:37,280000 --> 0:41:42,920000
got very very low LDL to two different ranges and so everyone from anywhere

468
0:41:42,920000 --> 0:41:47,800000
from above that threshold of 70 all the way down to some patients that got LDLs

469
0:41:47,800000 --> 0:41:53,360000
less than 20 and so as you can see here the breakdown is most were in that 20

470
0:41:53,360000 --> 0:41:58,320000
to 39 range so about 40 percent but you did have about 25% of the population

471
0:41:58,320000 --> 0:42:02,600000
that got into that less than 20 range and we didn't see any safety concerns

472
0:42:02,600000 --> 0:42:08,120000
when looking at that so they looked at each of these subgroups individually to

473
0:42:08,120000 --> 0:42:14,560000
evaluate whether there was concern there so long-term this data supports the

474
0:42:14,560000 --> 0:42:19,720000
approach that achieving even very low LDLs potentially less than 20 in this

475
0:42:19,720000 --> 0:42:24,400000
high-risk patient population could further lower cardiovascular events and

476
0:42:24,440000 --> 0:42:33,680000
probably doesn't have a safety signal or concern. Further in this analysis this

477
0:42:33,680000 --> 0:42:37,880000
is just further data when they controlled for a number of risks and

478
0:42:37,880000 --> 0:42:43,200000
adjusted for that in their analysis and all those parameters are listed with the

479
0:42:43,200000 --> 0:42:47,160000
asterisks at the bottom here when they can pull for those their primary

480
0:42:47,160000 --> 0:42:51,400000
cardiovascular endpoint the main one still proved to be statistically

481
0:42:51,440000 --> 0:42:55,400000
significant as well as your traditional three-point mace and so even after a

482
0:42:55,400000 --> 0:42:59,960000
controlling for a number of actors there still was further evidence that LDL

483
0:42:59,960000 --> 0:43:07,360000
lowering and in aggressive fashion could lower events. The last study that I'm

484
0:43:07,360000 --> 0:43:10,960000
going to talk about from a PCSK9 and I have a standpoint before we transition

485
0:43:10,960000 --> 0:43:16,920000
to some of the other agents is epic STEMI and so this is a very small study

486
0:43:16,920000 --> 0:43:20,720000
that was recently published last year and highlights potential to use some of

487
0:43:20,760000 --> 0:43:24,240000
these more aggressive therapies in addition to statin so they looked at

488
0:43:24,240000 --> 0:43:29,840000
using alarochomab in the hospital setting after someone's had a STEMI

489
0:43:29,840000 --> 0:43:34,700000
and so saw pretty pronounced LDL lowering so in the trial got patients

490
0:43:34,700000 --> 0:43:40,260000
down to 31 but does warrant a further study because this is a pretty short

491
0:43:40,260000 --> 0:43:44,640000
trial in nature and so they only follow patients up for about a month and a half

492
0:43:44,680000 --> 0:43:51,600000
post event and so would need to follow up for a much lengthier time to evaluate

493
0:43:51,600000 --> 0:43:56,120000
is this agents that we should be initiating from an inpatient standpoint

494
0:43:56,120000 --> 0:44:02,400000
to aggressively lower LDL in addition to kind of our traditional approaches.

495
0:44:04,680000 --> 0:44:11,440000
So next up we're gonna highlight Bumpadoc acid so Matt had mentioned that in

496
0:44:11,960000 --> 0:44:18,520000
the 2022 expert consensus decision pathway that Bumpadoc acid was kind of

497
0:44:18,520000 --> 0:44:23,640000
below is that am I PCSK9 inhibitor so because of that we didn't have clinical

498
0:44:23,640000 --> 0:44:28,240000
trial data that had looked at major cardiovascular events at that point.

499
0:44:28,240000 --> 0:44:34,040000
We do have one outcome trial that I will talk about today and so I'll kind of

500
0:44:34,040000 --> 0:44:38,160000
cover the landscape of what trials have been looked at so you get a sense of

501
0:44:38,160000 --> 0:44:42,560000
kind of what LDL lowering you could see with these agents in addition to

502
0:44:42,560000 --> 0:44:47,600000
statin therapy or in some instances we'll talk about their outcome study

503
0:44:47,600000 --> 0:44:51,720000
evaluated patients that had quote statin intolerance and so many of those

504
0:44:51,720000 --> 0:44:56,240000
patients weren't even on statin therapy in the trial and and still saw an event

505
0:44:56,240000 --> 0:45:04,080000
lowering with that patient population. So there's a series of clinical trials

506
0:45:04,080000 --> 0:45:08,440000
with Bumpadoc acid and so these are called the Clear Clear series and so

507
0:45:08,440000 --> 0:45:12
there's Clear Harmony, Clear Wisdom, Clear Serenity, Tranquility and then

508
0:45:12 --> 0:45:17,440000
Outcomes was their outcome trial and so as you can see here some of their initial

509
0:45:17,440000 --> 0:45:21,480000
studies were smaller in nature looked at very high-risk patient population so

510
0:45:21,480000 --> 0:45:26,520000
those that have had established AS-CVD those that were heterozygous familial

511
0:45:26,520000 --> 0:45:30,960000
hyperclustralemia patients and those that were already receiving maximum

512
0:45:30,960000 --> 0:45:38,640000
tolerated statin therapy and so in this trial these trials you can see many of

513
0:45:38,640000 --> 0:45:43,640000
them had a little bit higher level of baseline LDLs in the trials you can see

514
0:45:43,640000 --> 0:45:50
Serenity baseline trial was 158 to keep of note and that trials of those are

515
0:45:50 --> 0:45:53,680000
patients that weren't on statin therapy because they had previous statin

516
0:45:53,680000 --> 0:45:57,440000
intolerances and so that's probably likely why they were a little bit higher

517
0:45:57,520000 --> 0:46:02,520000
than some of the other trials. I'll focus in much greater detail on clear outcomes

518
0:46:02,520000 --> 0:46:07,960000
since that's their major cardiovascular outcome trial but just to highlight a

519
0:46:07,960000 --> 0:46:12,400000
lot of the initial studies were looking at LDL percent LDL lowering so we know

520
0:46:12,400000 --> 0:46:16,480000
that the FDA approves lipid lowering agents based on LDL lowering and does

521
0:46:16,480000 --> 0:46:21,920000
not require you to have cardiovascular outcome trials to come to market and

522
0:46:21,920000 --> 0:46:26,200000
so as you can see here there's a range there of LDL lowering across these

523
0:46:26,200000 --> 0:46:34,040000
studies so anywhere from 15% up to 28% in tranquility which of no include the

524
0:46:34,040000 --> 0:46:38,560000
combination of themadoc acid plus azetamide so there is a combination product

525
0:46:38,560000 --> 0:46:43,720000
that exists that's biphidoc acid alone or biphidoc acid plus azetamide and so as

526
0:46:43,720000 --> 0:46:48,320000
you can see here probably getting in more of a kind of moderate intensity

527
0:46:48,320000 --> 0:46:53,680000
statin dose range of LDL lowering with that combination product. With outcomes

528
0:46:53,960000 --> 0:47:00,680000
trial that was published in May or sorry in March of this year they looked at

529
0:47:00,680000 --> 0:47:05,040000
major cardiovascular endpoints so they looked at cv death non-vatal MI non-vatal

530
0:47:05,040000 --> 0:47:10,600000
stroke as well as revascularization. So in this study pretty large patient

531
0:47:10,600000 --> 0:47:15,200000
populations so just under 14,000 patients as you can see here not

532
0:47:15,200000 --> 0:47:19,800000
necessarily fits into our older patient population so a mean age of 66 in the

533
0:47:19,840000 --> 0:47:25,080000
trial and patients had to have established a CBD or be very high risk for

534
0:47:25,080000 --> 0:47:31,800000
cardiovascular disease. A pretty wide age age in the trial so 18 to 85 and they

535
0:47:31,800000 --> 0:47:39,640000
just had to have a baseline LDL more than 100. As you can see here they came in

536
0:47:39,640000 --> 0:47:46,520000
with a pretty elevated LDL baseline so 139 but as mentioned before most of these

537
0:47:46,520000 --> 0:47:51,080000
patients weren't on statin therapy and so the focus was amelulating could this

538
0:47:51,080000 --> 0:47:57,440000
demonstrate cardiovascular outcome event lowering in a population that maybe is

539
0:47:57,440000 --> 0:48:02,640000
intolerant or not able to tolerate statins. About 10% of patients are on

540
0:48:02,640000 --> 0:48:06,640000
statin therapy in the trial they just were on lower doses of statins based on

541
0:48:06,640000 --> 0:48:11,080000
the tolerance piece. They looked at your traditional three-point mace and that's

542
0:48:11,080000 --> 0:48:14,720000
kind of a trend you've seen with a lot of these trials that they've had a larger

543
0:48:14,760000 --> 0:48:18,160000
cardiovascular outcome that's four or five point for their primary endpoint and

544
0:48:18,160000 --> 0:48:21,680000
then more your traditional three-point mace tends to be one of their secondary

545
0:48:21,680000 --> 0:48:26,800000
outcomes. When you look at the data whether you look at their primary which is on

546
0:48:26,800000 --> 0:48:31,040000
the left or their secondary outcome the three-point mace on the right both

547
0:48:31,040000 --> 0:48:36,200000
proved to be statistically significant and in a similar range so 13% reduction

548
0:48:36,200000 --> 0:48:41,520000
in events with their primary and 15% relative risk reduction in their

549
0:48:41,560000 --> 0:48:45,320000
secondary outcome. As you can see here these patients didn't get to address

550
0:48:45,320000 --> 0:48:50,040000
the LDLs and so this is a trial that demonstrated bimpedalic acid in this

551
0:48:50,040000 --> 0:48:56,160000
population can lower cardiovascular events but it hasn't been evaluated in

552
0:48:56,160000 --> 0:49:01,360000
addition to statin therapy or other therapies like PCSK9s and azetamide to

553
0:49:01,360000 --> 0:49:05,480000
necessarily demonstrate that you're going to see a dramatic event lower

554
0:49:05,480000 --> 0:49:09,800000
rate at lower levels so I think that's one area where we do need to see some

555
0:49:09,840000 --> 0:49:14,080000
more data but I think it's an opportunity to say maybe bimpedalic acid kind of

556
0:49:14,080000 --> 0:49:18,720000
moves up the rank when you look at that expert consensus pathway as a potential

557
0:49:18,720000 --> 0:49:22,840000
option because you're probably getting LDL lowering in a similar range that you

558
0:49:22,840000 --> 0:49:28,600000
would get with azetamide. All right and so then we're going to round out this

559
0:49:28,600000 --> 0:49:35,840000
section before I turn it back over to Matt with some data on and closer in.

560
0:49:35,840000 --> 0:49:43
So similar to bimpedalic acid there's a series of trials and these are called

561
0:49:43 --> 0:49:48,840000
Orion trials. I have not included all of them on this slide but these are some of

562
0:49:48,840000 --> 0:49:55
them more pronounced or larger studies Orion 10 and 11 and Orion 3 the first

563
0:49:55 --> 0:50:00,840000
two there are ones that are published on Orion 4 is that one that we're waiting

564
0:50:00,880000 --> 0:50:06,480000
for so that's their large cardiovascular outcome trial and we probably don't see

565
0:50:06,480000 --> 0:50:12,520000
that out for a couple years and so that will give us more insight into are we

566
0:50:12,520000 --> 0:50:17,440000
going to see the same event lowering that we see with PCSK9s with and

567
0:50:17,440000 --> 0:50:23,600000
cluster in and so I think more to come on that but in at least in the Orion 10 and

568
0:50:23,600000 --> 0:50:28,440000
11 and Orion 3 studies they looked at those that had established AS CBD and

569
0:50:29 --> 0:50:36,480000
they looked over AS CBD risk equivalents pretty pronounced LDL baseline most were

570
0:50:36,480000 --> 0:50:43,920000
on other therapies as well in the trial and so this was added versus placebo and

571
0:50:43,920000 --> 0:50:50,600000
what you saw is somewhere between about a 45 to 50% LDL lowering when you looked

572
0:50:50,600000 --> 0:50:56,800000
at each of the trials so probably an option or opportunity if added to your

573
0:50:56,840000 --> 0:51:00,640000
traditional statin therapy in a high-risk AS CBD patient that you're probably

574
0:51:00,640000 --> 0:51:05,120000
going to get them in that less than 55 range potentially or maybe even more

575
0:51:05,120000 --> 0:51:11
aggressive less than 40 as I mentioned Orion 4 is still ongoing and so we

576
0:51:11 --> 0:51:16
don't have that data yet and then Orion 8 is specifically looking at those that

577
0:51:16 --> 0:51:21,800000
achieve specific LDL targets of less than 100 and less than 70 respectively one of

578
0:51:21,800000 --> 0:51:26,400000
the things that's unique within cluster and is it's an injectable product but

579
0:51:26,400000 --> 0:51:31,080000
it's one injection in the in the office followed by an injection at three months

580
0:51:31,080000 --> 0:51:35,520000
and then an injection every six months thereafter so we know that medication

581
0:51:35,520000 --> 0:51:40,200000
adherence can be an issue with lots of chronic therapies and so over time if we

582
0:51:40,200000 --> 0:51:44,480000
see more of these trials finished and we do see the outcome data I think you could

583
0:51:44,480000 --> 0:51:49,480000
start to see and cluster and be more commonly used to help maximize LDL

584
0:51:49,520000 --> 0:51:54,040000
lowering especially with those chronically just needing two injections a

585
0:51:54,040000 --> 0:52:00,480000
year. Alright so we're going to jump back to our patient case so just to remind

586
0:52:00,480000 --> 0:52:04,920000
everybody so we have a 50 year old male has a history of multiple cardiovascular

587
0:52:04,920000 --> 0:52:12,160000
risk factors has a history of multiple events so history of MI and stroke is on

588
0:52:12,160000 --> 0:52:17,560000
a longer list of medicines some may be appropriate some may not is on

589
0:52:17,640000 --> 0:52:21,760000
rasue the statin and azetamide from a cholesterol standpoint and when you

590
0:52:21,760000 --> 0:52:30,400000
look at his LDL today it's 80 so our if we revisit our question about the expert

591
0:52:30,400000 --> 0:52:36,040000
consensus decision pathway from 2022 what would you say this patients LDL target

592
0:52:36,040000 --> 0:52:42,880000
reduction is as well as what threshold should be be intensifying therapy

593
0:52:43,640000 --> 0:52:49,600000
we almost got a hundred percent so so yeah so if you go back to the consensus

594
0:52:49,600000 --> 0:52:54,240000
pathway and a lot of that trial data that we kind of highlighted if someone has

595
0:52:54,240000 --> 0:53:00,560000
an LDL greater than 55 from ACC at least a perspective that's someone that we do

596
0:53:00,560000 --> 0:53:05
want to intensify therapy further and try to target that at least a reduction

597
0:53:05 --> 0:53:12,200000
LDL by 50 percent. Alright other question so if we were to evaluate this

598
0:53:12,200000 --> 0:53:18,120000
for the 2019 European guidelines what would you say this person's LDL target

599
0:53:18,120000 --> 0:53:25,600000
would be so most are choosing that less than 40 so if you recall back to those

600
0:53:25,600000 --> 0:53:31,840000
guidance documents from ESC in 2019 they actually advocated so a person with

601
0:53:31,840000 --> 0:53:35,120000
multiple events and at least one of those events in the last two years we

602
0:53:35,120000 --> 0:53:39,080000
probably need to maximize their therapy even more and aggressively lower their

603
0:53:39,080000 --> 0:53:43,320000
LDL less than 40 they still would advocate you know if you're not able to

604
0:53:43,320000 --> 0:53:47,280000
get to 40 at least trying to shoot for less than 55 but highlighting that

605
0:53:47,280000 --> 0:53:52,200000
patient population that that we probably should be more aggressive with. Alright

606
0:53:52,200000 --> 0:53:56,160000
so I'm gonna circle back to a couple other items so Matt had already talked

607
0:53:56,160000 --> 0:54:03,120000
about this but just revisiting this guidance document from ESC that our

608
0:54:03,120000 --> 0:54:07,160000
patient would fit into that very high-risk bucket but kind of this last point

609
0:54:07,160000 --> 0:54:12,160000
here trying to target that LDL less than 40 because of the multiple events

610
0:54:12,160000 --> 0:54:18,320000
knowing that they have a high residual risk to have another event over time.

611
0:54:19,320000 --> 0:54:23,640000
Alright and so what do we want to do for our patient so they're already on

612
0:54:23,680000 --> 0:54:27,240000
or soovastatin they're already on azetamib do we want to just leave them on

613
0:54:27,240000 --> 0:54:32,040000
that do you want to add evaloicomab do you want to add bampadoc acid or do we

614
0:54:32,040000 --> 0:54:35,400000
want to add icosa pen ethyl.

615
0:54:37,360000 --> 0:54:43,520000
Alright so majority choosing evaloicomab I would say that's the kind of

616
0:54:43,520000 --> 0:54:47,920000
preferred option from the consensus pathway especially when looking at how

617
0:54:47,920000 --> 0:54:52,360000
far from their LDL threshold are they so they were at 80 they need to get down

618
0:54:52,440000 --> 0:54:56,600000
to at least 55 you're probably not getting there with bampadoc acid alone

619
0:54:56,600000 --> 0:55:02
plus the pathway gives preference to at least a BCSK9 before bampadoc acid

620
0:55:02 --> 0:55:07,360000
currently we're not focusing on triglycerides today but I could I

621
0:55:07,360000 --> 0:55:11,240000
co-subthen ethyl if maximized on their current therapy from an LDL

622
0:55:11,240000 --> 0:55:16,200000
standpoint could be a future consideration if the patient had moderately

623
0:55:16,200000 --> 0:55:21,360000
elevated triglycerides but for the focus on LDL today evaloicomab would be

624
0:55:21,360000 --> 0:55:27,480000
the best option. Alright and so just to remind everybody that we've kind of

625
0:55:27,480000 --> 0:55:32,720000
harped on this magic 55 number extensively and potentially less than 45

626
0:55:32,720000 --> 0:55:37,200000
or less than 40 depending on which guideline you look at tried to highlight

627
0:55:37,200000 --> 0:55:41,640000
that there is clinical trial data across now multiple agents PCSK9

628
0:55:41,640000 --> 0:55:47,680000
inhibitors a combination of statins and azetamib and some outcome data with

629
0:55:47,760000 --> 0:55:54,920000
bampadoc acid that we now have that some more options in our toolbox to help

630
0:55:54,920000 --> 0:55:59,840000
aggressively lower LDLs to at least less than 55 and and that very high risk

631
0:55:59,840000 --> 0:56:06,160000
population or those that have elevated LDL baseline knowing that we know the

632
0:56:06,160000 --> 0:56:10,720000
familial hypercluster all-imia patients are very high risk for future events

633
0:56:10,720000 --> 0:56:16,840000
as well and with that I will switch back for Matt to kind of wrap us up on our

634
0:56:16,840000 --> 0:56:19,320000
third case.

635
0:56:26,200000 --> 0:56:34,640000
Alright thanks Joel. Okay so we wanted to spend this next section to focus on the

636
0:56:34,640000 --> 0:56:41,680000
older adult population and given given the title of our presentation there was

637
0:56:41,680000 --> 0:56:46,880000
a request for Joel and I to do the limbo later but I think we will be running

638
0:56:46,880000 --> 0:56:53,520000
out of time unfortunately for that. So patient case so thinking about the

639
0:56:53,520000 --> 0:56:58,880000
the older adult population so 80 year old woman history of hypertension comes

640
0:56:58,880000 --> 0:57:07,120000
into the clinic lives alone but you know you can emulate on assisted meds lipid

641
0:57:07,120000 --> 0:57:14,320000
panel are here so thinking about this patient looking at the lipid panel what

642
0:57:14,320000 --> 0:57:19,120000
is what do you all think is the best recommendation for the patient's lipid

643
0:57:19,120000 --> 0:57:21,600000
management.

644
0:57:24,600000 --> 0:57:30,640000
Alright looks like we have about half the group leading towards the

645
0:57:30,640000 --> 0:57:33,760000
SED risk.

646
0:57:36,480000 --> 0:57:43,720000
Alright we'll keep going we'll see. So you know when we talk about the older adult

647
0:57:43,720000 --> 0:57:49,240000
population we've touched on this but there's you know there's not much

648
0:57:49,240000 --> 0:57:53,720000
guidance out there from you know randomized controls trial standpoint

649
0:57:53,720000 --> 0:58:00,520000
with this older population. You know a few amount of adults older adults enrolled

650
0:58:00,520000 --> 0:58:05,040000
and we already saw that the guidelines you know above 75 don't really provide

651
0:58:05,040000 --> 0:58:09,800000
much recommendation for us and there's even other kind of guidance or

652
0:58:09,800000 --> 0:58:14
documents out there like choosing wisely appear that's you know if there's

653
0:58:14 --> 0:58:20,440000
limited life expectancy recommending against DANs and then the US PSTF

654
0:58:20,440000 --> 0:58:26,680000
document that came out last year around primary prevention didn't weigh for or

655
0:58:26,680000 --> 0:58:32
against it but you know said there's insufficient evidence to kind of balance

656
0:58:32 --> 0:58:36,800000
the benefit and harm if they're 76 or older so there's there's this challenge

657
0:58:36,800000 --> 0:58:42,840000
year of okay so if we have these patients that are older than 75 what what do we

658
0:58:42,840000 --> 0:58:47,680000
do and there you know there's some value concerns so you know you're concerned

659
0:58:47,680000 --> 0:58:52,400000
about adverse effects drug interactions polypharmacy you know life expectancy

660
0:58:52,400000 --> 0:58:57,760000
and because of that you know literature shown there's a there's a

661
0:58:57,760000 --> 0:59:03,960000
decrease in use of lipid lowering drugs and older adults they're less likely to

662
0:59:03,960000 --> 0:59:09
be treated with high intensity stands for secondary prevention but you know on

663
0:59:09 --> 0:59:14,680000
the other side of that we've seen that statin discontinuation in this population

664
0:59:14,680000 --> 0:59:19,040000
can actually result in increased cardiovascular events so you know these

665
0:59:19,040000 --> 0:59:25,240000
these older older patients that have had sentences continued there's some

666
0:59:25,240000 --> 0:59:32,680000
literature showing that then there's kind of these events that happen or you

667
0:59:32,680000 --> 0:59:36,520000
know increased risk after the fact so more so of course in the secondary

668
0:59:36,520000 --> 0:59:39,840000
population or secondary prevention population but even in the primary

669
0:59:39,840000 --> 0:59:47,480000
prevention so without a bunch of you know randomized controlled trial support

670
0:59:47,480000 --> 0:59:52,680000
for this group you know there is literature more from the you know the

671
0:59:52,680000 --> 0:59:56,920000
retrospective or the different types of you know analysis and you know one

672
0:59:56,920000 --> 1:00:01,040000
highlighting here this is a Danish you know registry study so they looked at

673
1:00:01,040000 --> 1:00:07,360000
they looked at patients above 50 years old it's getting initiated lipid lowering

674
1:00:07,360000 --> 1:00:14,880000
treatment the and really comparing the group of above 70 and less than 70 from

675
1:00:14,880000 --> 1:00:20,480000
an outcome standpoint and you know there's a good number of patients included in

676
1:00:20,480000 --> 1:00:27,360000
the analysis it's all that with the mean reduction LDL we saw you know a

677
1:00:27,360000 --> 1:00:31,880000
lower risk of major CV events of course but the you know the most notable I

678
1:00:31,880000 --> 1:00:36,880000
think finding here of course is the there there wasn't any I guess difference or

679
1:00:36,880000 --> 1:00:41,960000
kind of supports the same benefit of both treating the above 70 year old

680
1:00:41,960000 --> 1:00:48,880000
patient population and the less than 70 year old so so this is kind of support to

681
1:00:48,880000 --> 1:00:55,120000
treat both the the kind of younger and older and in a similar approach

682
1:00:56,120000 --> 1:01:01,960000
similar here you know there's there's you know more I think you know meta

683
1:01:01,960000 --> 1:01:08,840000
analysis shows that if we you know intensify stand therapy or initiate in

684
1:01:08,840000 --> 1:01:13
this population we can see a proportional reduction in major cardiovascular

685
1:01:13 --> 1:01:17,960000
events there's a veteran study you know retrospective study associated with

686
1:01:17,960000 --> 1:01:27,320000
lower mortality and folks treated with stands above 75 and you know really

687
1:01:27,320000 --> 1:01:32,200000
pointing out that you know while it's not this randomized controlled trials

688
1:01:32,200000 --> 1:01:36,880000
support there is literature suggesting that you know we can get the additional

689
1:01:36,880000 --> 1:01:45,720000
benefit if we if we lower LDL in this population so some considerations the

690
1:01:45,800000 --> 1:01:50,120000
you know the American Geriatric Society they had their annual meeting and there

691
1:01:50,120000 --> 1:01:54,560000
was you know a panel talking about some recommendations on this topic and it

692
1:01:54,560000 --> 1:01:57,800000
was just kind of preliminary recommendations but highlighting that the

693
1:01:57,800000 --> 1:02:05,480000
challenges in this patient population and you know supporting though that you

694
1:02:05,480000 --> 1:02:11,080000
know they recognize that the lower LDL you know is associated with decreased

695
1:02:11,080000 --> 1:02:16,080000
as you need so you know recognizing that this is a this is a group that's

696
1:02:16,080000 --> 1:02:21,320000
does need to be considered for treatment and really the the kind of

697
1:02:21,320000 --> 1:02:25,680000
preliminary or the the recommendations at that time is really to focus on you

698
1:02:25,680000 --> 1:02:30,080000
know focus on the risk assessment and you know there was an emphasis on the

699
1:02:30,080000 --> 1:02:34,960000
coronary artery or calcium score so meaning that for some of these folks you

700
1:02:34,960000 --> 1:02:38,440000
know especially in this primary prevention population you know knowing

701
1:02:38,440000 --> 1:02:45,240000
the coronary artery calcium score can help of course with our guidance so you

702
1:02:45,240000 --> 1:02:50,880000
know if the score is zero then for that that patient the likeliness of a

703
1:02:50,880000 --> 1:02:58,080000
cardiovascular event is as much closer to zero as well there's gonna be some good

704
1:02:58,080000 --> 1:03:02,880000
trials unfortunately not enough to talk about in this presentation but you know

705
1:03:02,880000 --> 1:03:08,400000
there are gonna be some timely and helpful trials looking at this old

706
1:03:08,400000 --> 1:03:13,520000
population getting you know high intensity statin versus placebo so knowing

707
1:03:13,520000 --> 1:03:20,840000
does this high intensity statin benefit them? Starry will come out in late 2025

708
1:03:20,840000 --> 1:03:28,200000
and then the preventable trial so I think I think the results of those trials

709
1:03:28,200000 --> 1:03:33,440000
will will of course give us some good perspective and guidance on how we treat

710
1:03:33,440000 --> 1:03:39,200000
this population even after that though I think there's potential because you

711
1:03:39,200000 --> 1:03:41,840000
know both of these trials are getting towards 10-4 so they're getting this

712
1:03:41,840000 --> 1:03:46,040000
high intensity statin I think even after that there might be some question on the

713
1:03:46,040000 --> 1:03:51,920000
best strategy so is it is that high intensity really the the best approach or

714
1:03:51,920000 --> 1:03:55,040000
will there be you know additional questions on would maybe a lower

715
1:03:55,040000 --> 1:04:00,480000
intensity statin plus a non-statin be the better option so you know that's

716
1:04:00,560000 --> 1:04:03,640000
always exciting then what to have new literature coming out but then of course

717
1:04:03,640000 --> 1:04:11,480000
it brings additional questions non-statin lipid lowering options so you know

718
1:04:11,480000 --> 1:04:16,320000
prior to this is mostly stands this is I think the at least the third time we've

719
1:04:16,320000 --> 1:04:20,920000
talked about improve it so I won't talk about too much but the you know the

720
1:04:20,920000 --> 1:04:27,080000
greater absolute risk reduction was in that older age group utopia that was

721
1:04:27,720000 --> 1:04:33,880000
a study done in Japan patients randomized to a zetamai or not and you know the

722
1:04:33,880000 --> 1:04:39
the trial potentially had some limitations but you know as far as

723
1:04:39 --> 1:04:43,640000
having limited literature in this population it was a good trial to

724
1:04:43,640000 --> 1:04:47,800000
consider in that you know treating these patients with a zetamai a non-statin

725
1:04:47,800000 --> 1:04:53,640000
option did show a benefit in their primary endpoint and then the clear

726
1:04:53,640000 --> 1:04:58,160000
outcomes you know these other trials that continue to come out will have their

727
1:04:58,160000 --> 1:05:03,280000
different maybe subgroups or age categories where we can see you know

728
1:05:03,280000 --> 1:05:11,280000
some benefit in these these older individuals okay so if we go back to

729
1:05:11,280000 --> 1:05:21,520000
this patient the question is anything any opinions change or not on managing

730
1:05:21,520000 --> 1:05:33,120000
this patient okay so we looks like we're changing

731
1:05:35,120000 --> 1:05:43,040000
so best recommendation feels like you know when you show questions of the

732
1:05:43,040000 --> 1:05:45,880000
students and they start changing their answer based on how their classmates

733
1:05:45,880000 --> 1:05:54,960000
respond but no I think so this is good so maybe maybe more support towards for

734
1:05:54,960000 --> 1:05:59,320000
this patient you know that's a primary prevention patient not a lot of risk

735
1:05:59,320000 --> 1:06:06,720000
factors so could that CAC score help kind of guide the decision you know the

736
1:06:06,720000 --> 1:06:11,200000
10 year AACVD risk given that the patient's 80 potentially then doesn't

737
1:06:11,200000 --> 1:06:16,560000
have too much application the atorps at 40 so that's a higher density statin I

738
1:06:16,560000 --> 1:06:21,200000
think that you know those maybe future trials will help us there with that

739
1:06:21,200000 --> 1:06:27
answer so maybe in a few years that answer changes but I think a good good

740
1:06:27 --> 1:06:32,680000
response on the CAC score so let's say the score was done you know to this

741
1:06:32,680000 --> 1:06:38,800000
patient you know it's confirmed that it's elevated started on a torvastatin

742
1:06:38,800000 --> 1:06:44,120000
10 milligrams so patients complain of some muscle pains

743
1:06:44,120000 --> 1:06:51,240000
cramping so something to think about for this case so start on torvastatin muscle

744
1:06:51,240000 --> 1:06:59,400000
pains cramping so this question I wouldn't think so much specifically to

745
1:06:59,400000 --> 1:07:05,840000
2018 but you know thinking about you know what guidance do we have on what

746
1:07:06,320000 --> 1:07:11,600000
which should this patients kind of LDLC in reduction beam

747
1:07:11,600000 --> 1:07:32,440000
all right most of the group going for greater than 30%

748
1:07:32,760000 --> 1:07:39,800000
should have one more question so and then as far as the muscle pains and the

749
1:07:39,800000 --> 1:07:46,920000
grant what's the recommendation

750
1:07:46,920000 --> 1:07:59,520000
all right most of the group wants to assess for the possible causes of muscle

751
1:07:59,520000 --> 1:08:05,120000
symptoms oh this is just kind of a reminder of kind of where we're at with

752
1:08:05,120000 --> 1:08:09,360000
this primary prevention patient so you know we have these these figures that

753
1:08:09,360000 --> 1:08:14,040000
that are providing these these guideline documents but you know patients greater

754
1:08:14,040000 --> 1:08:21,280000
than 75 so really we're starting to think about you know this risk discussion

755
1:08:21,280000 --> 1:08:26,400000
you know as far as supporting the CAC and other recommendations around

756
1:08:26,400000 --> 1:08:31,440000
potentially moderate to 10 C stat for these primary prevention folks could

757
1:08:31,440000 --> 1:08:35,040000
give some indication of where the you know the most appropriate LDLC

758
1:08:35,040000 --> 1:08:40,380000
production might be but you know as you know throughout this

759
1:08:40,380000 --> 1:08:46,920000
pretend presentation we talk about these lowering of LDL goals you know higher

760
1:08:46,920000 --> 1:08:52,600000
intensity stands of course to get these and then these other agents you know

761
1:08:52,600000 --> 1:08:57,080000
it's appropriate in this population to talk about sanitolerance so it's

762
1:08:57,080000 --> 1:09:06,440000
obviously a big topic within this broader topic but last year you know

763
1:09:06,440000 --> 1:09:11,400000
there was a NLA scientific statement that kind of revisited this idea of

764
1:09:11,400000 --> 1:09:17,640000
what's truly stand intolerance and you know it the recommendations there's

765
1:09:17,640000 --> 1:09:22,360000
both kind of a complete and partial intolerance but really it's it's kind

766
1:09:22,360000 --> 1:09:26,520000
of clarifying or emphasizing this is a minimum of two statins you know being

767
1:09:26,520000 --> 1:09:33,560000
attempted with the least one at the lowest approved dosage and you know

768
1:09:33,560000 --> 1:09:36,560000
different different trials that have or you know different literature that's

769
1:09:36,560000 --> 1:09:41,800000
looked at this you know the prevalence of sanitolerance is such a wide range

770
1:09:41,800000 --> 1:09:46,680000
you know five or thirty percent but you know different meta-analysis have

771
1:09:46,680000 --> 1:09:55,560000
supported that you know though the maybe there's been you know some some minor

772
1:09:55,560000 --> 1:10:00,080000
increases in muscle pain or weakness there's there's no kind of continued or

773
1:10:00,080000 --> 1:10:04,120000
significant increases that are generally seen and and most of the patients with

774
1:10:04,120000 --> 1:10:13,120000
muscle symptoms it tends not to be due to the statin so always good to be

775
1:10:13,120000 --> 1:10:17,040000
thinking about considering especially as we're going to potentially be

776
1:10:17,040000 --> 1:10:22,120000
advocating for more more treatment in this population will this be a kind of

777
1:10:22,120000 --> 1:10:28,320000
topic that becomes more prevalent so on the expert consensus decision pathway

778
1:10:28,320000 --> 1:10:32,400000
you know there was there was a section on you know what to do with this possible

779
1:10:32,400000 --> 1:10:38,560000
stand associated side effects with the once again the recommendation here and

780
1:10:38,560000 --> 1:10:43,560000
line with the NLA two statins one attempt the lower the lowest FDA-approved

781
1:10:43,560000 --> 1:10:48,320000
dosage and you know in that document there's there's multiple times where

782
1:10:48,320000 --> 1:10:52,360000
it's you know it's as considered referral to lipid specialist and you know that's

783
1:10:52,360000 --> 1:10:57,040000
of course pharmacists we can be in the position to be lipid specialist in and

784
1:10:57,040000 --> 1:11:03,440000
be in position to to serve as that support where otherwise other lipid

785
1:11:03,440000 --> 1:11:10,520000
specialist might not be available so from there you know similar recommendations

786
1:11:10,520000 --> 1:11:16,520000
to what we've seen as far as the kind of next line of agents so really for a lot

787
1:11:16,520000 --> 1:11:21,440000
of these folks it's then if there if there actually is some standard tolerance

788
1:11:21,440000 --> 1:11:27,440000
then is edamite or PCSK9 inhibitor in that document have got the kind of

789
1:11:27,440000 --> 1:11:32,480000
first-line recommendation but as we see more trials coming out there could be

790
1:11:32,480000 --> 1:11:37,600000
you know other options like dump-doke acid and such could get pumped in higher to the

791
1:11:37,600000 --> 1:11:48,800000
the list okay so coming back to this one the groups thoughts on really target LDLC

792
1:11:48,800000 --> 1:11:58,880000
reduction for this patient all right so I agree with what the groups had and so you

793
1:11:58,880000 --> 1:12:03,840000
know that that greater than 30% reduction you know that's in line with at least a

794
1:12:03,840000 --> 1:12:08,360000
moderate intensity kind of primary prevention patient and and likely our

795
1:12:08,360000 --> 1:12:14,720000
best best target with you know both the guideline recommendations but the the

796
1:12:14,720000 --> 1:12:22,240000
evidence we've seen so far most appropriate intervention

797
1:12:28,880000 --> 1:12:41,120000
most of the group going let's assess for the possible cause and muscle symptoms so yes

798
1:12:41,120000 --> 1:12:46,760000
those she was just you know just started on torus statin initially no other

799
1:12:46,760000 --> 1:12:50,840000
stands have been tried yet so you know not at the point where we can say she's

800
1:12:50,840000 --> 1:12:58,120000
intolerant really first to see you know make sure there's not other causes other

801
1:12:58,200000 --> 1:13:01,800000
causes going on before we make a change

802
1:13:05,280000 --> 1:13:09,760000
all right so I think we're looking at wrapping things up here so you know the

803
1:13:09,760000 --> 1:13:16,880000
main the main takeaway so Joel and I probably impressed upon you the these

804
1:13:16,880000 --> 1:13:22,960000
lower these very low targets for these sub populations but this trend of where

805
1:13:22,960000 --> 1:13:27,880000
these lower LDLs are going in I think it you know like I said the beginning I

806
1:13:27,880000 --> 1:13:30,280000
think this creates a lot of opportunity for pharmacists a lot of

807
1:13:30,280000 --> 1:13:36,440000
opportunities to intervene with non-statin options and you know so to

808
1:13:36,440000 --> 1:13:42,800000
support the patients if as we can more aggressive lipidolrin therapy

809
1:13:42,800000 --> 1:13:48,720000
multiple agents and then you know the older the older adults I think you know

810
1:13:48,720000 --> 1:13:55,920000
we're we're seeing now that you know as we as we continue to update these

811
1:13:55,960000 --> 1:14:00,640000
guidelines and more kind of more evidence or more gaps and where the

812
1:14:00,640000 --> 1:14:05,720000
research needs to focus and update so you know some update on some of these

813
1:14:05,720000 --> 1:14:09,720000
newer options but then even in the sub populations like the the older patient

814
1:14:09,720000 --> 1:14:16
population so we probably do have time to do a limbo but we're still not doing

815
1:14:16 --> 1:14:22,760000
that and I think we're just open for questions

816
1:14:22,760000 --> 1:14:25,200000
right

817
1:14:35,800000 --> 1:14:43,400000
hi ready for questions sure go ahead my name is Matt Cantrell and from Iowa we

818
1:14:43,400000 --> 1:14:48,640000
have providers or believers and I co-spent Ethel can you just describe kind

819
1:14:48,640000 --> 1:14:53,960000
of which way the winds blowing on that agent which is largely LDL neutral but

820
1:14:53,960000 --> 1:14:58,120000
and how it might fit in the new guidelines if at all especially in a lower is better

821
1:14:58,120000 --> 1:15:06,680000
model so there was a similar to the non-statin expert clinical decision or

822
1:15:06,680000 --> 1:15:11,440000
consensus decision pathway there was one for hyper triglycerideemia that was

823
1:15:11,480000 --> 1:15:16,200000
published as well and so they actually have an algorithm of kind of where I

824
1:15:16,200000 --> 1:15:20,880000
co-spent Ethel kind of fits in there and so we didn't include it today but

825
1:15:20,880000 --> 1:15:25,760000
basically it kind of walks through of you know LDL should still predominantly be

826
1:15:25,760000 --> 1:15:31,440000
kind of your your you know first step options but once you've maximized kind of

827
1:15:31,440000 --> 1:15:36,360000
that LDL lowering and if you still do fit into that population that was

828
1:15:36,360000 --> 1:15:42,840000
evaluated and reduce it which was basically established a CBD or diabetes

829
1:15:42,840000 --> 1:15:50,760000
with risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 they showed cardiovascular

830
1:15:50,760000 --> 1:15:55,760000
event rates and so I think in practice you will see some people maybe

831
1:15:55,760000 --> 1:15:59,480000
potentially consider it before you're reaching your LDL target but a lot of

832
1:15:59,480000 --> 1:16:04,400000
the guidance now I would say argues that you probably want to try to maximize

833
1:16:04,400000 --> 1:16:11,280000
that LDL is is kind of the first step as as mentioned we do see some LDL

834
1:16:11,280000 --> 1:16:15,500000
changes when you use combination products of DHA EPA but the I guess a

835
1:16:15,500000 --> 1:16:20,240000
panethal generally does not affect your LDL

836
1:16:20,520000 --> 1:16:25,320000
thanks for good talk this is my question up here about Zeddi I've got a bunch of

837
1:16:25,320000 --> 1:16:31,040000
providers who statin and talent are not patients don't read their LDL goals and

838
1:16:31,080000 --> 1:16:35,480000
their thought is you know the Zeddi is not necessarily as effective as a PCSK9

839
1:16:35,480000 --> 1:16:39,040000
inhibitor and so what we just started off and decreased polypharmacy will hit

840
1:16:39,040000 --> 1:16:43,120000
their goal quicker you guys just thoughts on cost effective prescribing

841
1:16:43,120000 --> 1:16:47,480000
obviously has added my biz generic that PCS can either not and so it's kind of

842
1:16:47,480000 --> 1:16:53,200000
this tug and pull that I do with some of the providers yeah so excellent

843
1:16:53,200000 --> 1:16:59,080000
question so I think it comes up commonly in many practices because the you know

844
1:16:59,080000 --> 1:17:03,440000
no matter which guy then you look at from any of the low ones we covered still

845
1:17:03,440000 --> 1:17:08,520000
and a highlight considering is that am I when that that next non-statin option

846
1:17:08,520000 --> 1:17:14,240000
knowing that from a cost standpoint and oftentimes access standpoint unfortunately

847
1:17:14,240000 --> 1:17:18,360000
many times patients have to get that added before they're gonna get a PCSK9

848
1:17:18,360000 --> 1:17:21,800000
improved and so I think some of it's acknowledging that you're probably not

849
1:17:21,800000 --> 1:17:25,080000
gonna get their goal for a lot of these folks that we're gonna be more

850
1:17:25,080000 --> 1:17:30,720000
aggressive with LDL lowering and sometimes it's kind of sacrificing that

851
1:17:30,720000 --> 1:17:35,680000
you know sometimes initiating that so that they can get access to a PCSK9 to

852
1:17:35,680000 --> 1:17:39,840000
try to get them to a very low LDL

853
1:17:42,560000 --> 1:17:47,480000
let me see if we any other questions or we'll try to run through some of these

854
1:17:47,480000 --> 1:17:49,920000
that are up here

855
1:17:55,920000 --> 1:18:00
so the last question I think is interesting so why is why is the achieved

856
1:18:00 --> 1:18:03,480000
LDL in these trials being hailed as the reason for the CB risk reduction rather

857
1:18:03,480000 --> 1:18:08,600000
than the agents itself and so I think that brings up a good question so if

858
1:18:08,600000 --> 1:18:13,040000
you think back to most statin clinical trials that were done they put people

859
1:18:13,040000 --> 1:18:19,440000
on fixed those statins and they got to whatever LDL they got to that holds true

860
1:18:19,440000 --> 1:18:23,760000
for some of these trials but some with some of the PCSK9 inhibitor trials they

861
1:18:23,800000 --> 1:18:28,520000
actually if people got too low on the trial they actually backed off on the

862
1:18:28,520000 --> 1:18:32,360000
doses and some of those so they did adjust the doses in some of these trials

863
1:18:32,360000 --> 1:18:39,680000
but not all and so it kind of depends on the agent I think as we're getting into

864
1:18:39,680000 --> 1:18:44,320000
the realm of to get someone to less than 55 you're looking at probably at least

865
1:18:44,320000 --> 1:18:50,800000
two agents and then potentially three to get them there and so I think the

866
1:18:51,240000 --> 1:18:56,720000
struggle is it's you can't dissociate kind of the the drug from where they

867
1:18:56,720000 --> 1:19:01,200000
achieve their LDL but I think it's it's a good point and then highlights that

868
1:19:01,200000 --> 1:19:08,040000
most lipid-lural trials used fixed dose agents but as we've seen more and more

869
1:19:08,040000 --> 1:19:14
aggressive therapy I think and more guidelines kind of go back to this

870
1:19:14 --> 1:19:19
targeted approach I think you're seeing that highlighted more because I think

871
1:19:19,480000 --> 1:19:25
one thing that we saw when kind of in 2013 when we went to this more statin

872
1:19:25 --> 1:19:28,960000
benefit group we often had a lot of people not even rechecking lipid-lural

873
1:19:28,960000 --> 1:19:34,960000
or rechecking cholesterol values and sometimes not even assessing whether we

874
1:19:34,960000 --> 1:19:40,040000
should be more aggressive so I think it's hard to separate out the need to

875
1:19:40,040000 --> 1:19:44,560000
recheck LDL values after initiating therapy whether monotherapy or

876
1:19:44,560000 --> 1:19:47,440000
combination therapy

877
1:19:49 --> 1:19:58,560000
I have a question if you'll yeah it's a great talk therapeutic inertia is you

878
1:19:58,560000 --> 1:20:02
know extremely problematic in practice there's still a lot of providers out

879
1:20:02 --> 1:20:06,560000
there not even checking LDL cholesterol levels do you see us moving

880
1:20:06,560000 --> 1:20:11,680000
eventually to where we start patients out on combination lipid-luraling therapy

881
1:20:11,680000 --> 1:20:16
especially those at very high risk similar to how we treat patients that

882
1:20:16 --> 1:20:19,360000
have stage two hypertension where we're starting with two drugs do you think

883
1:20:19,360000 --> 1:20:22,480000
a that would be feasible do you think that we're gonna eventually kind of get

884
1:20:22,480000 --> 1:20:26,680000
to that point where we go ahead and proceed with two drugs to try to address

885
1:20:26,680000 --> 1:20:31,240000
some of that therapeutic inertia that we see so often in practice yeah no I

886
1:20:31,240000 --> 1:20:35,560000
think that's an excellent question I think it ties to you know if we can

887
1:20:35,560000 --> 1:20:40,480000
start to see a few more studies especially in kind of acute coronaries

888
1:20:40,480000 --> 1:20:44,160000
in the room and some of those are do we need to add statins plus PCSK9s and

889
1:20:44,240000 --> 1:20:49,600000
that acute window and follow up from there I think is an interesting approach

890
1:20:49,600000 --> 1:20:55,400000
and so I think I think it's an opportunity I don't think we're kind of

891
1:20:55,400000 --> 1:21:00,480000
there yet with some of the literature but especially as you know if we continue

892
1:21:00,480000 --> 1:21:05,080000
to see trials demonstrate you know even going less than 55 is is gonna

893
1:21:05,080000 --> 1:21:10,440000
optimize their risk-luraling therapy that I think you're gonna have to change

894
1:21:10,440000 --> 1:21:14,080000
the mindset of you know maybe combination therapy like you mentioned

895
1:21:14,080000 --> 1:21:19
that we see in other disease states like hypertension of starting off with

896
1:21:19 --> 1:21:25,360000
two drugs from the giga I agree I mean you'll think about how you know I could

897
1:21:25,360000 --> 1:21:31
see it get in there how you're gonna get to that that lower level you know my

898
1:21:31 --> 1:21:34,840000
population health perspective you know right now that a lot of these providers

899
1:21:34,840000 --> 1:21:39,840000
are healthy just the statin measures you know statin diabetes statin cardiovascular

900
1:21:39,840000 --> 1:21:45,520000
disease I think it would be interesting to in the future if some of those metrics

901
1:21:45,520000 --> 1:21:51,080000
start to change to and how that will change the maybe some of the behavior

902
1:21:51,080000 --> 1:22:00,600000
I think the one question up there about the low incidence of hemorrhagic stroke

903
1:22:00,600000 --> 1:22:05,600000
and comparing that to the rates of the scheme of stroke in the US I think is an

904
1:22:05,640000 --> 1:22:11,320000
interesting question I think the analysis that we presented from that meta

905
1:22:11,320000 --> 1:22:18
analysis included enough trials to you know detect a difference but I fully

906
1:22:18 --> 1:22:21,360000
acknowledged the rates of hemorrhagic stroke in many of those trials is rather

907
1:22:21,360000 --> 1:22:28,040000
low and so I think there is the statistical risk in evaluating that but

908
1:22:28,040000 --> 1:22:33,640000
across that analysis there really wasn't any kind of signal that indicated there

909
1:22:33,640000 --> 1:22:38,680000
was a difference in getting to very low levels and so I think it's something

910
1:22:38,680000 --> 1:22:44,240000
that will be continued to be monitored and looking at some of these trials even

911
1:22:44,240000 --> 1:22:48,240000
longer and so we kind of covered some of those trials are now open label and

912
1:22:48,240000 --> 1:22:51,840000
looking at some of these safety markers over time that it will will be something

913
1:22:51,840000 --> 1:22:56,360000
that will continue needed to do some surveillance to evaluate is this you

914
1:22:56,360000 --> 1:23:02,640000
know is long-term exposure to very low LDLs that you know potentially be harmful

915
1:23:02,640000 --> 1:23:05,720000
in some populations

916
1:23:09,800000 --> 1:23:14,800000
the first question I think is a question that comes up a lot so is there data to

917
1:23:14,800000 --> 1:23:18,240000
source starting statins or lipo-learning therapy in patients with diabetes before

918
1:23:18,240000 --> 1:23:26
40 I think there's limited data to justify that but I would say clinically

919
1:23:26 --> 1:23:30,920000
in practice that does come up sometimes and so I think it's taking that more

920
1:23:31,080000 --> 1:23:36,520000
big-picture global approach of doing a full risk assessment and evaluating

921
1:23:36,520000 --> 1:23:42,200000
whether that is someone that would benefit but we don't necessarily from a

922
1:23:42,200000 --> 1:23:48,080000
trial standpoint have a lot of literature to support that that's beneficial

923
1:23:48,080000 --> 1:23:51,160000
under the age of 40.

924
1:23:51,160000 --> 1:23:53,760000
Great.

925
1:23:54,640000 --> 1:24:01,320000
And so the last question hello is too low I think that's a great question so a lot

926
1:24:01,320000 --> 1:24:06,880000
of the the trials kind of backed off of people got below 200 but as I mentioned

927
1:24:06,880000 --> 1:24:11,960000
that one analysis there was about 25% that were in that that group and so

928
1:24:11,960000 --> 1:24:18,680000
there hasn't been any absolute number but I would say most if you're gonna

929
1:24:18,720000 --> 1:24:23,080000
target that less than 40 kind of very aggressive target most probably are

930
1:24:23,080000 --> 1:24:27,320000
uncomfortable clinically going below 20 but I don't know that there's any data

931
1:24:27,320000 --> 1:24:32,680000
that says that that's more or less harmful that we know yet.

932
1:24:34,480000 --> 1:24:39,560000
I think we're at time Joel and I can hang out if there's any. Yeah so there's

933
1:24:39,560000 --> 1:24:42,320000
questions I think there's a session in here in 15 minutes but you have

934
1:24:42,320000 --> 1:24:45,400000
questions feel free to come up to the podium and we will try to address us.

935
1:24:45,400000 --> 1:24:48,400000
Thank you for your time. Thank you.
