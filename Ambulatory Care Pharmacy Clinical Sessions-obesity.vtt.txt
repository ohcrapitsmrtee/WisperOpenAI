WEBVTT

1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:05,960000
Well, thank you all for being at this session right before lunch and we are going to talk about

2
0:00:06,360000 --> 0:00:08,880000
I'm in this session of the management of weight loss

3
0:00:08,880000 --> 0:00:16,280000
So the title of this presentation is weighing in the risk and benefits of treating obesity in adults and older adults

4
0:00:16,720000 --> 0:00:23,800000
And so as an introduction my name is Lordis Cross. I am an associate professor at Sullivan University College of Pharmacy in Louisville, Kentucky

5
0:00:23,880000 --> 0:00:29,640000
I also have a practice site at the University of Louisville Hospital and they're outpatient internal medicine clinic

6
0:00:29,640000 --> 0:00:34,460000
And endocrinology clinic and my co-presenter with me here today is Dana Carroll

7
0:00:34,720000 --> 0:00:39,240000
She is a clinical professor at Auburn University Harrison School of Pharmacy

8
0:00:39,240000 --> 0:00:46,400000
And she practices at Alabama University Medical Center with the Department of or the Department of Family Medicine

9
0:00:48,440000 --> 0:00:51,720000
And we have no financial relationships to disclose

10
0:00:53,480000 --> 0:00:59,360000
So that will get to the heart of this presentation our learning objectives today includes summarizing evidence

11
0:01:00,040000 --> 0:01:02,040000
recommendations for weight loss management

12
0:01:02,560000 --> 0:01:12,400000
evaluating recent literature addressing the use of newer anti-obc medications in adults and older adults as well as comparing the safety and efficacy of those weight loss medications

13
0:01:12,400000 --> 0:01:18,380000
And then recommending a treatment and monitoring plan for weight management using patient specific factors

14
0:01:19,840000 --> 0:01:22,700000
So I'm excited to talk about this topic

15
0:01:22,700000 --> 0:01:27,440000
I think it's become a popular topic both because of the newer weight loss medications

16
0:01:27,520000 --> 0:01:32,380000
that have been approved and then the really good data that we are seeing with these weight loss medications

17
0:01:33,120000 --> 0:01:39,320000
It's widely known that obesity is highly prevalent both worldwide and throughout the United States

18
0:01:39,520000 --> 0:01:44,020000
So if we go back to about two decades ago the prevalence of diabetes was around 30%

19
0:01:44,760000 --> 0:01:50,480000
Fast forward to today current prevalence of obesity in US adults is about 41.9%

20
0:01:51,320000 --> 0:01:56,800000
And we know that there is a link with obesity to chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease

21
0:01:58,440000 --> 0:02:02,440000
And if we look at those statistics in the older adult population

22
0:02:02,440000 --> 0:02:06,440000
So specifically in adults older than 60 years old

23
0:02:06,560000 --> 0:02:13,560000
We see about a 42% prevalence of obesity in that population defined as a BMI of greater than 30

24
0:02:13,560000 --> 0:02:16,560000
And if we look at those with severe obesity

25
0:02:16,560000 --> 0:02:20,920000
So BMI of a greater than 40 the prevalence rate is about 5.8%

26
0:02:21,920000 --> 0:02:25
Again similar trends as we saw with the general population

27
0:02:25 --> 0:02:27
So looking at two to three decades ago

28
0:02:27,520000 --> 0:02:31,080000
Fast-forwarding today that prevalence has increased about 20%

29
0:02:33,720000 --> 0:02:38,520000
So the American Association of clinical endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology

30
0:02:39,240000 --> 0:02:45,720000
Have proposed a new framework in terms of our approach to patients with obesity or those that are overweight

31
0:02:45,960000 --> 0:02:49,480000
And this is known as the adiposity based chronic disease model

32
0:02:50,040000 --> 0:02:52,440000
So the goal here is to recognize that

33
0:02:53,280000 --> 0:03:01,920000
Obesity is beyond a just weight problem beyond just looking at BMI and that there's other health conditions that are associated with that pathophysiology

34
0:03:02,560000 --> 0:03:10,880000
Linked to obesity and so some of these adiposity based chronic diseases include those cardiovascular diseases as well as chronic kidney disease

35
0:03:10,880000 --> 0:03:11,840000
GERD

36
0:03:11,840000 --> 0:03:17,080000
osteoarthritis prediabetes so you can see the fullest here and the goal is to

37
0:03:17,480000 --> 0:03:21,600000
Minimize the stigma and the bias associated with obesity

38
0:03:22 --> 0:03:27,880000
So again rather than just looking at weight as the main target but trying to minimize these complications

39
0:03:28,200000 --> 0:03:31,560000
associated with other comorbidities linked to it

40
0:03:33,680000 --> 0:03:38,280000
So this slide shows some of the guidelines associated with obesity management

41
0:03:38,560000 --> 0:03:43,680000
And in 2013 the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and the obesity society

42
0:03:44,160000 --> 0:03:51,280000
released a guideline related to management in patients that are overweight and obese and then a couple years later the endocrine society

43
0:03:51,840000 --> 0:04:00,040000
ACE and ACE also released a set of guidelines and then most recently in 2022 the American Gastroenterological Association

44
0:04:00,600000 --> 0:04:05,780000
released a set of guidelines that incorporated some of our neuro data so looking at those trials that assess

45
0:04:06,320000 --> 0:04:11,520000
Simagatide and they provide a good overview of the risk and the benefits and the place and therapy

46
0:04:11,760000 --> 0:04:14,280000
of these various weight loss medications

47
0:04:16,120000 --> 0:04:21,960000
In general our approach to therapy is to in all patients that are overweight and obese

48
0:04:21,960000 --> 0:04:27,160000
to initiate lifestyle modifications including dietary changes changes in physical activity

49
0:04:27,800000 --> 0:04:34,840000
pharmacotherapies generally recommended when the BMI is greater than 30 or in those of the BMI GERD than 27 with one weight related

50
0:04:34,840000 --> 0:04:43,920000
comorbidity and then bariatric surgery is generally recommended when BMI is greater than 40 or the BMI is greater than 35 and they have a weight related

51
0:04:44,280000 --> 0:04:45,680000
comorbidity

52
0:04:45,680000 --> 0:04:49,280000
Now however incorporating some of those ABCD complications

53
0:04:49,280000 --> 0:04:56,560000
We see like a slight change in the recommendations for approach to therapy. So with the 2023 AC consensus statements

54
0:04:56,680000 --> 0:05:04,760000
They are recommending potentially initiating summit of these weight loss medications earlier in those patients that are at high risk for those ABCD

55
0:05:05,200000 --> 0:05:10,320000
complications, so you can see maybe even as early as a BMI of 25 or greater

56
0:05:10,640000 --> 0:05:16,960000
And so again the big push is to recognize that we have these complications and that it's important to initiate therapy

57
0:05:17,240000 --> 0:05:19,680000
and interventions earlier in these patients

58
0:05:21,400000 --> 0:05:29,200000
And intervention is important in order to attain these goals of enhancing weight loss while maintaining lean body mass

59
0:05:29,880000 --> 0:05:33,280000
minimizing those long-term complications associated with this comorbidities

60
0:05:33,920000 --> 0:05:38,560000
Supporting appearance through those lifestyle modifications and then improving overall

61
0:05:39,160000 --> 0:05:42,480000
emotional physical well-being and quality of life

62
0:05:44,720000 --> 0:05:48,240000
So that thinks that we have our first audience response question here

63
0:05:48,240000 --> 0:05:54,760000
Which of the following patients would be the best candidate for initiation of an anti obesity medication as an adjunct to lifestyle

64
0:05:54,840000 --> 0:05:59,280000
Changes and I'll give you all a minute to choose what answer you think is best

65
0:06:03,280000 --> 0:06:16,960000
All right, so we see a division around A to C

66
0:06:17,600000 --> 0:06:24,440000
Following just general guidance from these guidelines and the best answer here would be C when looking at their BMI of 28

67
0:06:24,440000 --> 0:06:26,440000
But they also have these other health related

68
0:06:27,080000 --> 0:06:33,280000
Quormorbidities such as such as osteoarthritis and hypertension in this particular case

69
0:06:36,520000 --> 0:06:42,240000
And with that I'm going to provide a general overview of currently FDA approved medications for weight loss

70
0:06:42,720000 --> 0:06:44,720000
I'm going to provide general

71
0:06:45,040000 --> 0:06:51,880000
brief overview over the risk and the benefits and then Dana is going to come in later and talk about how these apply to our older adult population

72
0:06:52,880000 --> 0:06:58,040000
And so this is a timeline showing medications approved by the FDA for treating obesity

73
0:06:58,200000 --> 0:07:04,080000
There is a typo here when looking at Fensormine. It's actually been around for a long time first approved in 1959

74
0:07:04,640000 --> 0:07:09,120000
So it was one of our medications that is still around today that has been along for several decades

75
0:07:09,760000 --> 0:07:12,480000
And for a while there is a gap of there until 1999

76
0:07:12,480000 --> 0:07:20,480000
Oral a stat received approval and then another gap when our combination agent Fensormine to pyramid extended release was approved

77
0:07:20,520000 --> 0:07:25,400000
Then we saw now Trexo and Bproprior on receiver approval in 2014 and Loraga tied as well

78
0:07:25,400000 --> 0:07:28,720000
And then most recently some Aga tied in 2021

79
0:07:28,720000 --> 0:07:33,960000
I do have set melanatide here. It is not used for the general population for weight loss

80
0:07:34,600000 --> 0:07:37,280000
Specifically it's indicated for those that have a genetic

81
0:07:37,880000 --> 0:07:42,640000
Disorder related to weight games that won't be talking much about that particular agent

82
0:07:42,880000 --> 0:07:46,280000
And then most recently which did not make it into the slides

83
0:07:46,280000 --> 0:07:50,640000
But to Zepitai was approved last week for the management of obesity

84
0:07:51,080000 --> 0:07:55,760000
In patients without diabetes, so I'll be highlighting some trials associated with that

85
0:07:57,680000 --> 0:08:02,600000
Starting with Fensormine. This is one of our short-term agents approved for use of up to 12 weeks

86
0:08:03 --> 0:08:06,800000
It is a pathomimetic. So mainly works by suppressing appetites

87
0:08:07,120000 --> 0:08:10,320000
I'm in terms of efficacy with a baseline weight loss

88
0:08:10,680000 --> 0:08:15,160000
Generally around like the three to seven percent mark some modest weight loss

89
0:08:15,160000 --> 0:08:21,960000
And then because of its amphetamine like effects some of the side effects we see are insomnia irritability agitation

90
0:08:22,560000 --> 0:08:23,760000
nervousness

91
0:08:23,760000 --> 0:08:29,460000
In looking at large trials. It has not been shown to necessarily increase the risk of cardiovascular

92
0:08:30,240000 --> 0:08:33,880000
Events however, it can lead to a bump in heart rate and blood pressure

93
0:08:33,880000 --> 0:08:41,560000
So something to monitor closely and it should not be used in patients with the history of cardiovascular disease including those with uncontrolled hypertension

94
0:08:42,120000 --> 0:08:46,920000
And other contraindications include a history of hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, drug abuse

95
0:08:47,080000 --> 0:08:50,080000
As well as use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants

96
0:08:50,920000 --> 0:08:56,760000
Across the board all of these weight loss drugs should not be used in pregnant patients because we don't want to see active weight loss

97
0:08:56,920000 --> 0:09:03,600000
During that time frame however, some agents I'll talk about later can have some teratogenic effects as well

98
0:09:04,840000 --> 0:09:10,040000
So big takeaway here is that again only used for a short term or only FDA approved for that

99
0:09:10,160000 --> 0:09:13,440000
It is a schedule for a drug has potentially the

100
0:09:14,120000 --> 0:09:21,720000
potential for abuse and however trials have not necessarily shown an increase in addiction or abuse when used for weight loss

101
0:09:22,640000 --> 0:09:28,600000
Again monitoring that blood pressure closely and then discontinuing femur me at least four days before procedure requiring anesthesia

102
0:09:29,160000 --> 0:09:32,160000
Because of those side effects of hypertension and arrhythmias

103
0:09:33,680000 --> 0:09:38,200000
And now transitioning to our medications that are approved for long-term use in weight loss

104
0:09:38,440000 --> 0:09:46,320000
I'm starting with oral stats. It's oral drug use three times daily. It's a lipase inhibitor that decreases the absorption of dietary fats

105
0:09:46,560000 --> 0:09:53,160000
But because of that mechanism it leads to a lot of those intolerable side effects that often causes discontinuation of the agents

106
0:09:53,760000 --> 0:09:59,240000
So some of those side effects include the intestinal cramps, flatulence, oily spotting or leakage

107
0:09:59,920000 --> 0:10:01,920000
In terms of efficacy

108
0:10:01,920000 --> 0:10:07,200000
Modest with weight line base weight line base weight loss

109
0:10:07,840000 --> 0:10:11,360000
Excuse me. So it ranges around three to four percent with oralist sat

110
0:10:12,080000 --> 0:10:18,280000
And then again some of our contradications being chronic malabsorption syndrome and called sasis and pregnancy

111
0:10:19,080000 --> 0:10:26,080000
So big pearls to take away said minister during or up to one after one hour after each main meal and to admit the dose

112
0:10:26,080000 --> 0:10:30
If a patient is not eating or if it doesn't contain fat because of the mechanism

113
0:10:30 --> 0:10:36
It's not going to work to take with the multivitamin because it can impair the absorption of fat soluble vitamins

114
0:10:36,400000 --> 0:10:42,360000
ADE and especially vitamin D and to separate that multivitamin from oralist at least by two hours

115
0:10:42,720000 --> 0:10:46,640000
Also to be mindful of drug interactions such as liver, thoraxine and warfarin

116
0:10:47,040000 --> 0:10:53,640000
Especially with impairing absorption of that vitamin K looking at IR levels if they are on the warfarin potentially adjusting the dose

117
0:10:53,640000 --> 0:10:59,640000
So fencer means or pyramid is one of our combination agents

118
0:10:59,640000 --> 0:11:04,720000
It's hypothesized that we take two individual drugs that work in different parts of the brain

119
0:11:04,720000 --> 0:11:09,720000
We can help with that appetite suppression help with weight loss. So that's what we see here

120
0:11:10,040000 --> 0:11:12,520000
We get this empathic emetic effects of fencer mean

121
0:11:12,520000 --> 0:11:17,560000
But we also get some appetite suppression by modulating those GABA receptors with to pyramid

122
0:11:18,120000 --> 0:11:21,480000
In terms of weight loss slightly better than some of the drugs that we see

123
0:11:21,960000 --> 0:11:26,680000
mentioned previously ranges around 8 to 11 percent of baseline weight loss

124
0:11:27,880000 --> 0:11:29,560000
because of the

125
0:11:29,560000 --> 0:11:37,160000
Mechanism and the fencer mean components and those side effects or we're going to see include like dry mouth potentially elevated heart rate blood pressure

126
0:11:37,800000 --> 0:11:39,800000
Also might see constipation

127
0:11:40,040000 --> 0:11:43,560000
And then one that patients point out is the taste of servants

128
0:11:44,200000 --> 0:11:48,920000
So for example with drinking like soda they may have like metallic tastes or may taste flat

129
0:11:49,400000 --> 0:11:53,400000
Could potentially cause some aversion to further, you know drinking soda

130
0:11:54,200000 --> 0:11:59,560000
And then those contraindications again similar to the ones related to fencer mean as mentioned earlier

131
0:12:00,040000 --> 0:12:04,200000
And this is the one where with pregnancy definitely don't want to use any of these drugs

132
0:12:04,680000 --> 0:12:09,640000
But because of the pyramid components can increase the risk of oral cleft development

133
0:12:09,880000 --> 0:12:12,200000
If the fetus is exposed in that first trimester

134
0:12:12,760000 --> 0:12:17,640000
So it's recommended that a patient have a negative pregnancy test if they're of childbearing age

135
0:12:18,120000 --> 0:12:21,960000
Prior to starting this dose a drug and then monthly during use

136
0:12:22,600000 --> 0:12:24,600000
Again a schedule for a drug

137
0:12:24,680000 --> 0:12:32,840000
And then one population that may potentially benefit from this combination are those patients to have migraines because their pyramid could potentially help with migraine prevention

138
0:12:33,640000 --> 0:12:41,160000
Also to be my mindful that it may cause insomnia so that timing of the dose may be important and then adjusting for hepatic and renal impairment

139
0:12:43,160000 --> 0:12:46,920000
And then our next combination agent now truck zone be appropriate on extended release

140
0:12:47,560000 --> 0:12:55,560000
So this is believed to work synergistically to help reduce appetite as well as to work through that reward system to reduce cravings

141
0:12:56,200000 --> 0:13:01,720000
In terms of efficacy ranges around 5 to 6 percent of baseline weight loss

142
0:13:02,440000 --> 0:13:08,680000
And inside effects most common ones going to be nausea occurring in up to 30 percent of patients as well vomiting constipation

143
0:13:09 --> 0:13:11,480000
And then headache being fairly common as well

144
0:13:12,360000 --> 0:13:18,520000
Can also cause a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate so it should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled

145
0:13:19,320000 --> 0:13:25,400000
Hypertension as well as some notable ones such as if they have a history of seizures or if they have a eating disorder

146
0:13:26,200000 --> 0:13:31,160000
Another one to highlight here is that because now truck zone is an opioid antagonist

147
0:13:31,640000 --> 0:13:39,320000
And that it's important that we avoid using this drug and patients that are going to receive opioids because we don't want to counter the effects of those medications

148
0:13:40,200000 --> 0:13:44,520000
So some unique pearls with this one is that because of the bopropyrone being an antidepressant

149
0:13:44,520000 --> 0:13:49,320000
It does carry that box warning of suicidal thinking especially in younger patients

150
0:13:49,320000 --> 0:13:56,120000
But they're having pulled studies looking at to see if there's this actual increase risk in suicidal ideation or depression

151
0:13:56,120000 --> 0:14:00,200000
And they have not found that increase risk when used for weight loss

152
0:14:00,920000 --> 0:14:04,600000
I'm also being mindful to you adjust the dose for hepatic and renal impairment

153
0:14:05,320000 --> 0:14:12,440000
Again also carries that risk for insomnia and to non-miniscer with high fat meals because it can increase overall systemic exposure

154
0:14:15,240000 --> 0:14:23,400000
And now switching over to the drugs i've really been in the spotlight recently because of their weight loss efficacy our GLP1 or scepter agonists

155
0:14:24,040000 --> 0:14:31,480000
Specifically loragotide and somagotide which have their FDA approval for weight loss in patients with without diabetes

156
0:14:32,200000 --> 0:14:36,600000
Now as far as mechanism it's postulated that it has many different effects and how it works

157
0:14:37,160000 --> 0:14:43,640000
We know for sure that it lowers glucose and that glucose dependent manner suppresses glucagon release slows down gastric emptying

158
0:14:44,040000 --> 0:14:51,480000
Also believe to affect the regulation of appetite and caloric intake and maybe other effects that we don't fully know yet at this point

159
0:14:52,440000 --> 0:15:00,040000
Main side effect is going to be GI related one of the most common reasons why patients will stop therapy with a GLP1 so including nausea, vomiting

160
0:15:00,440000 --> 0:15:02,440000
constipation, diarrhea

161
0:15:03,080000 --> 0:15:08,040000
However overall when we look at the later studies in terms of continuing the GLP1

162
0:15:08,520000 --> 0:15:14,040000
It's not the GI effects do not tend to cause a high discontinuation rate in these trials

163
0:15:14,920000 --> 0:15:20,440000
Primary contraindications are to avoid those of the personal family history and medullary tharroid carcinoma

164
0:15:20,760000 --> 0:15:24,840000
Are those with the history of multiple endocrine neoplagia syndrome type 2

165
0:15:24,840000 --> 0:15:30,520000
And now looking into some of the literature related to these GLP1s

166
0:15:31,320000 --> 0:15:36,680000
Predominable again I highlight some of the effects with somagotide because it's one of our agents has shown really good efficacy

167
0:15:36,920000 --> 0:15:40,040000
With weight loss compared to our other FDA approved agents

168
0:15:40,680000 --> 0:15:48,680000
So looking at the step run trial these looked at patients with the BMI of 30 or greater or 27 or greater if they had a weight related to complication

169
0:15:49,400000 --> 0:15:57,080000
And so this was a 68 week trial that looked at some maglite that tie 2.4 milligrams sub q weekly versus placebo

170
0:15:57,880000 --> 0:16:03,240000
And what they found was that 86 percent of patients lost at least 5 percent of their baseline weight

171
0:16:03,880000 --> 0:16:06,440000
And that in general is the marker for success

172
0:16:07,240000 --> 0:16:09,240000
At least historically for these

173
0:16:09,320000 --> 0:16:13,320000
Patients is at least that 5 percent loss and weight at baseline

174
0:16:13,720000 --> 0:16:18,760000
If we look at the patients that lost at least 20 percent or more of their baseline weight

175
0:16:18,920000 --> 0:16:22,600000
That was about 32 a percent of patients that received some agitide

176
0:16:23,160000 --> 0:16:27,560000
So really good efficacy data in this particular trial as well as others

177
0:16:28,440000 --> 0:16:33,560000
And looking at the side effects again mainly GI related nausea diarrhea, vomiting constipation

178
0:16:34,040000 --> 0:16:40,760000
However, usually mild to moderate usually during that dose escalation period and typically transient in nature

179
0:16:41,240000 --> 0:16:49,320000
So in terms of discontinuation rates, it was around 4 to 5 percent in the treatment arm compared to about 1 percent in the placebo arm

180
0:16:49,880000 --> 0:16:53,400000
So while these patients are experiencing these GI side effects

181
0:16:53,960000 --> 0:16:57,960000
They typically does not cause them to discontinue the drug

182
0:16:58,280000 --> 0:17:03,160000
So that's a big counseling for patients that are going to start this diet. They can continue to be on the medication

183
0:17:03,640000 --> 0:17:06,280000
Those GI effects could potentially go away

184
0:17:06,760000 --> 0:17:08,760000
So

185
0:17:08,760000 --> 0:17:13,960000
Researchers also wanted to see what happens when we stop samagitide what happens to weight

186
0:17:14,040000 --> 0:17:17,480000
And then also some of these cardiovascular benefits that that we're seeing

187
0:17:17,880000 --> 0:17:19,880000
And so in the step one extension trial

188
0:17:20,520000 --> 0:17:27,320000
Again, same population there. They would got those patients from 0 to 68 weeks evaluate the weight loss and then stopped giving samagitide

189
0:17:27,720000 --> 0:17:30,680000
And followed them up for a year to see what would occur

190
0:17:31,240000 --> 0:17:37,480000
So what we saw is during the treatment period they had about a 17 on average percent decrease from baseline weight

191
0:17:38,040000 --> 0:17:44,600000
But once they stopped the drug and then 52 weeks later that samagitide group maintained a mean 5.6 weight loss

192
0:17:45,080000 --> 0:17:47,080000
from baseline 5.6 percent

193
0:17:48,280000 --> 0:17:55,720000
Also, most of the participants in that samagitide arm regain around two-thirds of their prior weight loss

194
0:17:56,600000 --> 0:17:58,600000
And then in terms of cardiovascular

195
0:17:58,920000 --> 0:18:00,920000
Variables that they looked at

196
0:18:01,400000 --> 0:18:06,840000
In the treatment phase they did see a decrease in lipids and fasting glucose and blood pressure

197
0:18:07,320000 --> 0:18:15,800000
But after they discontinued samagitide and they were followed up those cardiovascular benefits tended to revert back to their baseline numbers

198
0:18:16,360000 --> 0:18:21,480000
So big picture here is that this particular studies highlight the need for long-term

199
0:18:22,040000 --> 0:18:24,440000
Formical logic treatment. These are not short-term agents

200
0:18:24,840000 --> 0:18:28,040000
And if we want to maintain the weight loss if you want to maintain some of those

201
0:18:28,760000 --> 0:18:37
Cardiovascular benefits then these patients should be on these medications chronically same as we would see with patients have hypertension and dysphedemia

202
0:18:39,400000 --> 0:18:43,480000
And then most recently we have one of our trials that looked at oral samagitide

203
0:18:43,880000 --> 0:18:45,880000
Which shows some promising results as well

204
0:18:46,520000 --> 0:18:54,360000
In the oasis one trial they looked at patients similar population being migrated in 30 or greater than 27 if they had a weight related complication

205
0:18:54,760000 --> 0:19:00,360000
Follow them for 68 weeks. The treatment arm receives a maggotide 50 milligrams p.o daily

206
0:19:00,520000 --> 0:19:05,560000
So higher dose than we see use in patients type 2 diabetes and then versus placebo

207
0:19:06,520000 --> 0:19:13,080000
And looking at that primary outcome mean body weight change from baseline in the treatment arm their decrease in weight was 15

208
0:19:13,640000 --> 0:19:16,840000
Compared to 2% in the placebo arm

209
0:19:17,640000 --> 0:19:20,520000
In addition of looking at the body weight reduction

210
0:19:20,680000 --> 0:19:29,800000
So the patient population that had at least a 5% decrease in baseline weight was 85% in the samagitide arm versus 26 in the placebo group

211
0:19:30,600000 --> 0:19:35,720000
So again promising results because we're seeing a similar efficacy compared to our injectable

212
0:19:36,120000 --> 0:19:40,440000
Simagatide and then taking into consideration that this is an oral formulation

213
0:19:40,840000 --> 0:19:47,720000
So one of the big issues we're running into are the shortages related to increased demand and having to manufacture an injectable agent

214
0:19:48,040000 --> 0:19:50,920000
With oral medications it could potentially open up

215
0:19:51,560000 --> 0:19:58,120000
That window being easier to produce ship and store potentially meeting the demand with these weight loss medications

216
0:20:00,440000 --> 0:20:02,440000
So in summary with lereitide and samagatide

217
0:20:03,800000 --> 0:20:10,040000
Because they are glucose-learning agents definitely want to monitor glucose closely, especially if they're also fun areas or insulin

218
0:20:10,440000 --> 0:20:15,960000
May require a dose adjustment to prevent hypoglycemia also should not be used with DP before inhibitors

219
0:20:16,600000 --> 0:20:19,720000
And if a patient can't tolerate that maximum dose that was studied

220
0:20:19,720000 --> 0:20:24,520000
They may continue at a lower dose as long as they're still showing good efficacy at least that 5%

221
0:20:25,320000 --> 0:20:27,160000
decrease in body weight from baseline

222
0:20:27,880000 --> 0:20:33,240000
And because of those GI side effects it may be necessary to slow down that tapering process or the

223
0:20:33,640000 --> 0:20:38,200000
The titration process in order to help the patient better tolerate the medication

224
0:20:39,160000 --> 0:20:45,640000
Now there is also promising data related to cardiovascular outcomes like trial has yet to be published

225
0:20:46,120000 --> 0:20:48,120000
But it's looking at injectable samagatide

226
0:20:48,840000 --> 0:20:55,400000
And just preliminary news data kind of showing that it may potentially reduce the risk of cardiovascular events

227
0:20:56,120000 --> 0:20:59,560000
Which could potentially kind of change our approach to weight loss management

228
0:21:01,320000 --> 0:21:07,400000
And so this graph shows the average weight loss at one year looking at those fda approved agents with the exception of

229
0:21:07,800000 --> 0:21:14,600000
Terzapatide kind of big takeaways is that when looking at samagatide it tends to lead to a greater increase in weight loss

230
0:21:15 --> 0:21:18,920000
Compared to orla side which has the least amount of weight change

231
0:21:21,480000 --> 0:21:27,480000
And now jumping into septide which again was recently approved last week

232
0:21:28,280000 --> 0:21:35,160000
So its mechanism is a glp1 receptor agonist it also has agonist activity in the gip receptor

233
0:21:35,320000 --> 0:21:39,800000
So glucose dependent insulin the tropic polypeptide which is like a mouthful there

234
0:21:40,680000 --> 0:21:44,360000
Mechanism very similar to what we see with the glp1 similar profile

235
0:21:44,360000 --> 0:21:46,920000
with side effects as well as contrary indications

236
0:21:48,280000 --> 0:21:50,280000
Now looking into these studies

237
0:21:50,680000 --> 0:21:58,680000
So the surmount one trial looked at those that were overweight and obese without diabetes over a time frame of 72 weeks

238
0:21:59,400000 --> 0:22:04,280000
And looking at mean change at weight to that 72 week mark 15 milligram dose

239
0:22:04,680000 --> 0:22:09,160000
resulted in a decrease of 20 percent of their baseline weight

240
0:22:09,720000 --> 0:22:14,200000
So compared to some of the agents mentioned previously really good efficacy lowering data

241
0:22:14,760000 --> 0:22:16,760000
For this injectable at terzapatide

242
0:22:17,960000 --> 0:22:21,960000
Five milligram dose they had a 50 percent reduction in their baseline weight

243
0:22:21,960000 --> 0:22:24,680000
So still really good efficacy even at the lower dose

244
0:22:25,240000 --> 0:22:32,280000
And in terms of looking at least a 5 weight loss from baseline across the board a majority of patients ranging from 85 to 90

245
0:22:33,320000 --> 0:22:35,560000
Met that efficacy at point

246
0:22:36,120000 --> 0:22:43,720000
And again, we're seeing similar side effects as we saw with our other glp1. So typically gi related

247
0:22:45 --> 0:22:48,920000
Primarily during that dose escalation period usually mild usually transients

248
0:22:49,800000 --> 0:22:55,480000
So in terms of discontinuation rates for terzapatide it was around two to four percent compared to placebo

249
0:22:56,120000 --> 0:22:58,120000
Which was a little bit less than that

250
0:22:58,360000 --> 0:23:05,320000
So again, counseling patients that if they can continue on the drug those gi side effects are likely to go away over time

251
0:23:06,040000 --> 0:23:07,560000
And

252
0:23:07,560000 --> 0:23:10,120000
And i'm looking at the serp has five trials

253
0:23:10,200000 --> 0:23:14,520000
So this looked at patients that had to be a micro than 30 that were on insulin

254
0:23:14,600000 --> 0:23:17,880000
Glargine so they all had diabetes in this trial

255
0:23:18,600000 --> 0:23:24,920000
And the main things to point out was at the end of 40 weeks when looking at our very shortages the a1c decrease around

256
0:23:25,320000 --> 0:23:29,400000
2% up to like 2 to 3 2.3 percent with terzapatide

257
0:23:29,880000 --> 0:23:36,680000
Um, but I think to keep in mind is the protocol that they use in terms of decreasing that risk of hypoglycemia

258
0:23:37,160000 --> 0:23:41,640000
Um, so in this case if patients had a baseline a1c of 8 percent or less

259
0:23:42,200000 --> 0:23:49,160000
Um, then at randomization that insulin glargine dose was decreased by 20 to help again minimize that risk

260
0:23:49,640000 --> 0:23:54,680000
And so that is one of the key takeaways with these drugs that work through the glp and or dip pathways that again

261
0:23:55,080000 --> 0:24:01,560000
Might need to adjust the dose of soponary as an insulin and orders a minimize risk of hypoglycemia

262
0:24:02,040000 --> 0:24:04,920000
And again should not be used with the pb4 inhibitors

263
0:24:07,400000 --> 0:24:12,600000
So this chart just highlights some of the weight loss benefits we see with these fda approved agents

264
0:24:13 --> 0:24:17,800000
And then the other factor that definitely comes into play when selecting therapy, which is cost

265
0:24:18,360000 --> 0:24:23,240000
Um, and one of the main issues I run into in clinic is the affordability of these medications

266
0:24:23,720000 --> 0:24:31,080000
Um, so if you're looking at this list fentermine is going to be one of our cheaper options again fda approved for short-term weight loss management

267
0:24:31,480000 --> 0:24:37,480000
Or less that being one of our inexpensive options as well, but I don't think a lot of patients really like those gi side effects

268
0:24:37,560000 --> 0:24:40,040000
Tends to be a reason for poor adherence and discontinuation

269
0:24:40,680000 --> 0:24:45,160000
Um, so we see really good efficacy with our glp ones, but unfortunately really expensive

270
0:24:45,640000 --> 0:24:51,480000
Not a lot of insurances that cover them. Um, there are a couple states where their medicaid program actually does pay for them

271
0:24:51,560000 --> 0:24:57,080000
And sometimes there's some unique criteria surrounding that as well in order to keep it as a long-term medication

272
0:24:57,560000 --> 0:25:04,680000
Um, so this is probably one of the biggest considerations to keep in mind when selecting a medication for a patient

273
0:25:07,480000 --> 0:25:10,040000
All right, and that leads us to our first case here

274
0:25:10,040000 --> 0:25:16,440000
We have ts a 56 year old woman is presenting to the internal medicine office for a weight management consultation

275
0:25:16,840000 --> 0:25:25,560000
Past medical history includes hypertension obesity, dyslipidemia and chronic back pain meds include emlodipine at torvastatin lysinapril and tramadol

276
0:25:26,200000 --> 0:25:32,360000
And then vital signs to point out her BMI is 29 and blood pressure is 128 over 78

277
0:25:34,680000 --> 0:25:40,600000
Which one of the following additions to lifestyle interventions if any is best to recommend to manage ts's weight

278
0:25:41,320000 --> 0:25:45
I'll give you all a minute to read through those choices and select your response

279
0:25:46,440000 --> 0:25:48,440000
Okay

280
0:25:53,240000 --> 0:25:57,240000
All right majority say the glp1 receptor agonists absolutely

281
0:25:57,800000 --> 0:26:05,640000
Again, gi side effects, but usually not a reason for discontinuation and really good efficacy that we're seeing with those glp1 agents

282
0:26:07,800000 --> 0:26:11
This table highlights the route of administration and dosing of our

283
0:26:11,560000 --> 0:26:13,320000
FDA approved medications

284
0:26:13,880000 --> 0:26:16,600000
And again, some of the big takeaways for our glp1

285
0:26:17,080000 --> 0:26:22,200000
Agents here is that a patient may not be able to reach that maximum dose because of gi side effects

286
0:26:22,520000 --> 0:26:27,320000
And we may need to go up even slower than what's recommended in the prescribing

287
0:26:28,120000 --> 0:26:33,640000
Guidelines to titrate to these higher dosages just so they can tolerate those gi side effects

288
0:26:34,280000 --> 0:26:36,280000
And

289
0:26:36,280000 --> 0:26:42,040000
Then this for completion highlights the renal dose adjustments that are needed for our FDA approved drugs

290
0:26:42,680000 --> 0:26:50,040000
In particular fentermine and our combination agents need to be really dose adjusted whereas our injectables and oralist at do not

291
0:26:53,480000 --> 0:26:57,960000
And there are a lot of new medications that are currently being studied now showing

292
0:26:58,600000 --> 0:27:03,480000
Pretty decent if not really good weight loss efficacy in phase two trials

293
0:27:04,200000 --> 0:27:11,640000
For example, some notable ones to highlight red a chew tide is a triple agonist at the glp1 gip and glucagon receptor

294
0:27:12,200000 --> 0:27:14,200000
It's a once weekly injectable medication

295
0:27:14,760000 --> 0:27:18,840000
In phase two trials when they followed patients for up to 48 weeks

296
0:27:19,240000 --> 0:27:25,320000
They found a 24 decrease in a body weight at that point. So really good

297
0:27:26,200000 --> 0:27:31
Weight lowering agent there. So currently we study in phase three trials

298
0:27:31,560000 --> 0:27:33,400000
Another one or fogopron

299
0:27:33,400000 --> 0:27:35,400000
That one's a mouthful as well

300
0:27:35,400000 --> 0:27:40,360000
And so that one is an oral agent non peptide glp1 receptor agonists

301
0:27:41 --> 0:27:46,120000
So that unique factory there is that it's oral without restrictions to food and water intake

302
0:27:46,840000 --> 0:27:52,920000
Again potentially helping meet that demand with these weight loss drugs is potentially easier to produce and to ship and store

303
0:27:53,640000 --> 0:27:56,520000
And then there's a couple of unique ones here as well

304
0:27:57 --> 0:28:02,040000
So we have medications that are going to look at inhibition of s glt1 and 2

305
0:28:02,760000 --> 0:28:09,080000
We have ones that are targeting just glp as well as the glucagon receptor with those agonist

306
0:28:09,640000 --> 0:28:10,680000
Properties

307
0:28:10,680000 --> 0:28:17,560000
And then our monoclonal antibody potentially is being looked at as a one monthly IV injection

308
0:28:18,360000 --> 0:28:23,720000
For weight loss management. It's a lot of drugs being studied currently

309
0:28:25,240000 --> 0:28:29
So big picture when we are considering what drugs to select for a patient

310
0:28:29 --> 0:28:31,800000
There's a lot of factors who take into consideration

311
0:28:32,360000 --> 0:28:36,680000
Both their comorbidities. What is their motivation? What are patient preferences?

312
0:28:36,840000 --> 0:28:42,120000
Do they want oral drug an injectable agent looking at the overall safety and efficacy profiles

313
0:28:42,760000 --> 0:28:46,840000
And then again finances are they even able to afford some of these medications

314
0:28:47,480000 --> 0:28:49,480000
in the first place

315
0:28:52,040000 --> 0:28:58,440000
So in general weight loss medication should be discontinued and alternative treatment considered if their weight loss is less than 5

316
0:28:59 --> 0:29:04,360000
Of their body weight at that three month mark and more things have safety or tolerability issues

317
0:29:05,160000 --> 0:29:11,240000
Medication discontinuation is likely to lead to weight regain as we saw with the previous trial

318
0:29:11,720000 --> 0:29:18,600000
So that is a big counseling point that most patients regain their weight and might potentially lose some of those cardiovascular benefits

319
0:29:19,080000 --> 0:29:21,080000
That are seen

320
0:29:23,160000 --> 0:29:25,160000
And this leads us to our next case

321
0:29:25,320000 --> 0:29:30,040000
T s a 56 zero woman. Well, it's the same case again to present to the internal medicine office

322
0:29:30,440000 --> 0:29:33
As a reminder history of hypertension obesity

323
0:29:33,560000 --> 0:29:39
Describing back pain and taking and load of pain or nervous that my cinephral tram with all with the BMI of 29

324
0:29:39,480000 --> 0:29:41,880000
And a blood pressure of 128 over 78

325
0:29:43,800000 --> 0:29:50,440000
So t s is not interested in starting an injectable medication today. What would be an appropriate medication to initiate?

326
0:30:02,600000 --> 0:30:05,720000
All right majority state c some state b

327
0:30:06,360000 --> 0:30:11,160000
So the best one in this case would be fenter me to pyramid extended release

328
0:30:11,480000 --> 0:30:13,640000
For the fact that she is on tram at all again

329
0:30:13,640000 --> 0:30:19,080000
We don't want to have any antagonist effects with that opioid therapy by giving now truck zone and that now checks them

330
0:30:19,080000 --> 0:30:23,160000
We prokaryon combination or list that having low efficacy poor gi

331
0:30:23,320000 --> 0:30:30,280000
A tolerability definitely want to try to avoid that one and to resipitize being an injectable medication does not meet the patient's preference

332
0:30:30,520000 --> 0:30:32,520000
So

333
0:30:33,960000 --> 0:30:40,040000
Some key takeaways here is that pharmacologic treatment in general is recommended in those of the BMI over 30

334
0:30:40,360000 --> 0:30:43,800000
Or with the BMI of greater than 27 if they have an obesity related

335
0:30:44,440000 --> 0:30:52,360000
Co-morbidity again now kind of incorporating that framework of that abcd model where we are recognizing that obesity is linked to other chronic conditions

336
0:30:52,760000 --> 0:30:55,960000
And it may be important to initiate therapy even earlier

337
0:30:56,680000 --> 0:30:58,840000
Than these cutoffs and some patients

338
0:30:59,560000 --> 0:31:07,240000
Currently we have six FDA approved medications the market for long-term management of obesity with a lot of medications in the pipeline

339
0:31:07,320000 --> 0:31:10,440000
It's showing barely good efficacy in terms of weight loss

340
0:31:11,160000 --> 0:31:12,200000
and then

341
0:31:12,200000 --> 0:31:19,880000
Noting that for these patients if they stop the therapy they're likely to regain their weight and potentially lose again those cardiovascular benefits

342
0:31:19,880000 --> 0:31:25,320000
So these are long-term medications if we want to maintain the benefits that we are seeing

343
0:31:25,400000 --> 0:31:27,400000
And

344
0:31:28,360000 --> 0:31:30,840000
With that i'll pass the mic over to dana

345
0:31:38,920000 --> 0:31:40,920000
All right, so

346
0:31:42,520000 --> 0:31:47,960000
So what is it talked a little bit about the impact of obesity in a general adult population and a lot of those things

347
0:31:48,280000 --> 0:31:50,600000
Also play in in an older adult population

348
0:31:50,680000 --> 0:31:56,040000
But some things that are unique in our older adults are that we know it increases the aging process

349
0:31:56,520000 --> 0:31:58,760000
Significantly in older adults who are obese

350
0:31:59,560000 --> 0:32:02,840000
It also increases the risk of cancers in our older adults

351
0:32:02,920000 --> 0:32:09,240000
We know that breast cancer a uterine cancer and leukemia are more prevalent in older adults who have obesity

352
0:32:10,520000 --> 0:32:14,920000
The things that are probably some of the bigger ones that we maybe don't think about in our

353
0:32:15,560000 --> 0:32:19,960000
Younger or middle aged adult population that are obese compared to our older adults is that we have

354
0:32:20,200000 --> 0:32:27
Increases in mobility issues and fall risk and fall risk and older adults can have significant impacts on them long-term

355
0:32:27,960000 --> 0:32:29,960000
They do have increased pain

356
0:32:30,040000 --> 0:32:34,440000
Probably because a lot of times from the weight bearing that they're putting on their joints

357
0:32:34,840000 --> 0:32:40,680000
With osteoarthritis, but they because of this the increased pain the increased mobility issues

358
0:32:40,680000 --> 0:32:42,920000
They're going to have an increase in functional decline

359
0:32:43,240000 --> 0:32:49
We say in our older adults if you don't use it then you lose it and that's particularly prevalent with muscle

360
0:32:49,400000 --> 0:32:52,280000
Bass in our older adults. So when you start to have an

361
0:32:52,920000 --> 0:33:00,920000
Accelerated functional decline that increases the risk for frailty in those patients as well as increasing mortality because the higher the frailty rate

362
0:33:01,240000 --> 0:33:09,400000
The higher the mortality rate, but the mobility issues the mental health concerns the fall risk the increased pain in the functional decline

363
0:33:09,400000 --> 0:33:12,840000
significantly impact our older adult patients quality of life

364
0:33:14,520000 --> 0:33:17,480000
Because it does impact their functional abilities

365
0:33:17,480000 --> 0:33:22,600000
We see a decrease in their ability to perform ADLs and IADLs in their home

366
0:33:23,080000 --> 0:33:26,120000
That increases the risk and need for residential care

367
0:33:26,200000 --> 0:33:30,120000
So even if they can find someone that can come in and provide care

368
0:33:30,520000 --> 0:33:34,280000
They may not be able to provide the level of care that they need in the home

369
0:33:34,680000 --> 0:33:39,560000
Because of the obesity and the size requirements for care for those patients

370
0:33:41,160000 --> 0:33:46,280000
This also leads to increased hospitalization in our older adults and because they have multiple

371
0:33:46,680000 --> 0:33:50,440000
Curimabities like what has talked about earlier and we highlighted on the previous slide

372
0:33:50,840000 --> 0:33:54,360000
We're going to see them in and out of the hospitals much more frequently

373
0:33:54,760000 --> 0:33:59,800000
And that's going to lead to increased cost to the health care system both on the individual level

374
0:34:00,200000 --> 0:34:05,320000
As well as on the insurance supplemental insurance level and with medicare

375
0:34:05,880000 --> 0:34:07,320000
in 2020

376
0:34:07,320000 --> 0:34:11
It's estimated that 6.2 percent of the total medicare budget

377
0:34:11,400000 --> 0:34:19,320000
Was devoted to treating conditions related to obesity and that's expected to rise as we have an increase in obesity in our older adults

378
0:34:19,400000 --> 0:34:21,400000
Like lord us holla very early in the presentation

379
0:34:22,680000 --> 0:34:24,120000
the average

380
0:34:24,120000 --> 0:34:30,360000
Predicted annual medicare costs for a 65 year old with obesity in 2020 was 23 around 23 000

381
0:34:30,360000 --> 0:34:33,640000
And again, that's expected to increase with the

382
0:34:34,360000 --> 0:34:38,840000
estimated medicare expenditures for lifetime beneficiaries with obesity being at

383
0:34:39,480000 --> 0:34:45,160000
524 billion and again, that's expected to continue to rise the greatest cost to

384
0:34:46,120000 --> 0:34:49,800000
Medicare is in the last six months of life in patients with obesity

385
0:34:50,280000 --> 0:34:59,240000
So i'll pose an audience response question what for most appropriate measure to use to screen through obesity and older adults

386
0:35:10,200000 --> 0:35:14,600000
And it looks like you guys are choosing what's being proposed is the best answer

387
0:35:14,600000 --> 0:35:19
Which is ways to conference but you've heard us talk about BMI through this whole presentation

388
0:35:19,080000 --> 0:35:22,920000
And you're going to hear me continue to talk about BMI because that's where the literature is

389
0:35:23,400000 --> 0:35:26,680000
Currently and how we assess obesity in our older adults

390
0:35:27,640000 --> 0:35:32,680000
But the reason that we're having a conversation about maybe why that's not the best is because

391
0:35:33,240000 --> 0:35:35,640000
It's a difficult assessment in an older adult

392
0:35:35,720000 --> 0:35:39,800000
We know that older adults have decreased lean muscle mass and increased fat mass

393
0:35:40,200000 --> 0:35:42,520000
Oftentimes that fat mass is central

394
0:35:43,240000 --> 0:35:48,760000
Visceral fat mass and central fat mass, but we do see increases in skeletal fat mass and older adults

395
0:35:48,760000 --> 0:35:51,800000
Would decrease is the quality of muscle in those patients

396
0:35:52,360000 --> 0:35:53,800000
um

397
0:35:53,800000 --> 0:35:54,760000
And so we

398
0:35:54,760000 --> 0:35:57,800000
Underestimate to the amount of lean muscle in our older adults

399
0:35:58,200000 --> 0:36:05,880000
So the thought is that when we use BMI we're maybe underestimating or overestimating the fat mass in our older adults

400
0:36:06,360000 --> 0:36:09,560000
And so there's discussions and push to use

401
0:36:10,120000 --> 0:36:17,080000
Waster conference in our older adults as a measure in addition to maybe the BMI to see if that's

402
0:36:18,040000 --> 0:36:20,680000
Correlating to what we think might be going on. So

403
0:36:21,480000 --> 0:36:28,920000
Discos with the what the CDC recommends would be our waist or conference greater than 40 inches in men and greater than 35 inches in women

404
0:36:30,600000 --> 0:36:35,400000
So why don't we see an increase in obesity in our aging population?

405
0:36:35,400000 --> 0:36:41,240000
Now part of this could be related to the same factors that we see in younger adult and malays adult populations

406
0:36:41,800000 --> 0:36:47,320000
But there's also some pathophysiologic changes that are going on in our older adults that probably get heightened

407
0:36:47,800000 --> 0:36:51,400000
Um, so we know that there's decreased physical activity

408
0:36:52,120000 --> 0:36:57,320000
In older adults and that decreased physical activity results in decreased energy expenditure

409
0:36:57,720000 --> 0:37:05,400000
By those older adults. The other piece is that you have a decrease in your metabolic rate by two to three percent

410
0:37:05,960000 --> 0:37:07,960000
every decade as we age

411
0:37:08,920000 --> 0:37:14,520000
And so you're because of that decreased metabolic rate and then the decreased energy expenditures

412
0:37:14,920000 --> 0:37:16,920000
You're going to see that they're going to have

413
0:37:17,800000 --> 0:37:23,640000
Increased fat mass and decreased lean muscle mass. The other thing that's part of the aging process is that

414
0:37:23,960000 --> 0:37:28,600000
Between the age of 20 and 70 the statistics so depressing to me as I age

415
0:37:29,240000 --> 0:37:33,800000
Between 20 and 70 you are going to lose 40 percent of your lean muscle mass

416
0:37:34,600000 --> 0:37:40,520000
That's a large percentage now probably most of it is in that louder part 60s and 70s

417
0:37:40,840000 --> 0:37:45,960000
But that is a large amount of lean muscle mass and as we replace lean muscle mass that is

418
0:37:47 --> 0:37:49
Gracious. Sorry. I gotta put talking my hands

419
0:37:49,880000 --> 0:37:54,440000
Um that is replaced with fat mass in our patients

420
0:37:55 --> 0:38:00,520000
So in older adults that fat mass is going to the central area visceral fat central adiposity

421
0:38:01,080000 --> 0:38:05,400000
As we increase central adiposity, we're going to increase pro inflammatory cytokines

422
0:38:05,480000 --> 0:38:07,720000
So interleukin six and tnf alpha

423
0:38:08,120000 --> 0:38:11,640000
We're going to have increased increased insulin resistance in those patients

424
0:38:11,720000 --> 0:38:16,120000
And we're going to have decreases in hormone as part of the normal aging process that just gets accelerated

425
0:38:16,200000 --> 0:38:21,160000
So decreased testosterone which helps with muscle mass decreased progesterone decreased estrogen

426
0:38:21,880000 --> 0:38:27,160000
Decrease dha and growth hormone and all of those are going to contribute to

427
0:38:27,960000 --> 0:38:34,120000
Even more decrease in muscle mass and increases in fat mass. So you see how the cycle is going

428
0:38:34,120000 --> 0:38:38,760000
So we have an aging process and then we have the other lifestyle factors that factor in

429
0:38:40,120000 --> 0:38:43,480000
As we decrease muscle mass, we just talked about this a minute ago

430
0:38:43,720000 --> 0:38:49,240000
You have decreased mobility decreased functionality and then the patient's not as independent as they were

431
0:38:49,560000 --> 0:38:52,680000
So if they're not as independent at home, then they're not doing as much

432
0:38:53,320000 --> 0:38:55,320000
so we have again that

433
0:38:55,880000 --> 0:39:00,280000
Cycle that goes back to the top of decreased physical activity, decreased energy expenditure

434
0:39:00,360000 --> 0:39:03,800000
And so the cycle just continues to go in our older adults

435
0:39:05,560000 --> 0:39:11,240000
So which of the following bMRI ranges in older adults is associated with the lowest mortality rate?

436
0:39:26,280000 --> 0:39:28,520000
Very good. You guys have been

437
0:39:29,320000 --> 0:39:36,120000
Know your obesity in older adults. So it is between 25 and 30. This is known as the obesity paradox

438
0:39:36,680000 --> 0:39:41,320000
Um, we know that being overweight in older adults is considered protective

439
0:39:41,800000 --> 0:39:48,920000
They have decreased mortality rates compared to lower BMIs and higher BMIs and when you think about this

440
0:39:48,920000 --> 0:39:50,920000
This is in the overweight range, right?

441
0:39:51,480000 --> 0:39:52,520000
so

442
0:39:52,520000 --> 0:39:54,520000
The thought is that

443
0:39:54,520000 --> 0:39:57,560000
You had metabolic reserves if something happens

444
0:39:58,360000 --> 0:40:02,040000
Um, they have a better nutritional status and they may have

445
0:40:02,680000 --> 0:40:07,480000
Better muscle quality in the overweight range compared to their counterparts

446
0:40:08,200000 --> 0:40:10,200000
Intentional weight loss

447
0:40:11,240000 --> 0:40:14,440000
Can be detrimental to an older adult if it's not planned will

448
0:40:15 --> 0:40:18,440000
Unintentional weight loss is always detrimental to an older adult

449
0:40:18,840000 --> 0:40:19,880000
um

450
0:40:19,880000 --> 0:40:22,600000
So patients that are in the 30 to 35

451
0:40:23,400000 --> 0:40:27,720000
The literature is not super clear on if there's benefit or harm

452
0:40:28,120000 --> 0:40:33,480000
What tends to show in the literature is 30 31 maybe even 32 there's still benefit

453
0:40:33,480000 --> 0:40:35,560000
That's kind of where the curve shows you it's still

454
0:40:36,280000 --> 0:40:43,400000
Dipping but as you go up 35 and uh, there's definitely clear risk and increased mortality in this patient

455
0:40:44,120000 --> 0:40:46,120000
But being too small

456
0:40:46,600000 --> 0:40:50,440000
On that lower BMI also is an increased risk for our patients and again

457
0:40:50,440000 --> 0:40:56,840000
The thought is there's not good metabolic reserve or those patients may be on the unintentional weight loss and with things

458
0:40:59 --> 0:41:03,320000
So which of the following is a potential risk associated with weight loss and older adults?

459
0:41:16,120000 --> 0:41:18,120000
Okay

460
0:41:21,240000 --> 0:41:23,240000
Right, so sarcopenic obesity

461
0:41:24,120000 --> 0:41:28,440000
Is one of our greatest risks and we've already talked about loss of muscle or loss of quality

462
0:41:28,760000 --> 0:41:30,760000
Muscle mass so that's sarcopenia

463
0:41:31 --> 0:41:33
But what's happening there?

464
0:41:33,800000 --> 0:41:35,800000
We'll talk about a little bit more in just a minute

465
0:41:35,800000 --> 0:41:41,560000
But when we talk about weight loss in our older adults, we're always talking about weighing that risk versus benefit

466
0:41:41,960000 --> 0:41:45,640000
So the benefits lorist has talked about some of those already with our patients

467
0:41:45,640000 --> 0:41:49,640000
We have improved chronic disease management particularly cardiometabolic disease

468
0:41:50,280000 --> 0:41:54,600000
So that's a plus to weight loss. We also see improved mobility

469
0:41:55,640000 --> 0:41:58,280000
Because they have decreased pain from their osteoarthritis

470
0:41:58,840000 --> 0:42:03,720000
And they have improved mental health those have all been shown in older adults that had experienced weight loss

471
0:42:04,200000 --> 0:42:10,600000
That those are positives, but there's the negative side and we really have to consider that negative side as well

472
0:42:11,080000 --> 0:42:15,880000
So we know that there's increased dementia in patients who experience weight loss

473
0:42:17,160000 --> 0:42:23,400000
Increased risk for gallstones increased risk for fractures and that's primarily due to the loss of bone mineral density in those patients

474
0:42:23,800000 --> 0:42:28,600000
There's changes in the kinetics of drugs due to the increased fat mass decreased protein

475
0:42:29,080000 --> 0:42:31,080000
Our lean muscle for the patients

476
0:42:31,560000 --> 0:42:38,280000
We see an increase in frailty an increase in malnutrition and an increase in mortality to go with that sarcopenic obesity

477
0:42:38,600000 --> 0:42:42,280000
But why don't we get sarcopenic obesity in our older adults?

478
0:42:43,240000 --> 0:42:49,560000
So any weight loss in an older adult is going to have two things that happen unless you take active measures to try to prevent that

479
0:42:50,040000 --> 0:42:54,920000
The first is decreased muscle mass and the second is a decreased in bone mineral density

480
0:42:56,520000 --> 0:43:04,280000
Lortis has already talked about that oftentimes in patients that have weight loss if you stop the intervention then they're going to regain weight

481
0:43:05 --> 0:43:07
And that's true in older adults

482
0:43:07,480000 --> 0:43:13,640000
Whether they use medications or we do dietary modifications that they don't stick with or an exercise plan

483
0:43:14,440000 --> 0:43:21,560000
And the challenge with older adults is if say for example, they get sick and then they can't do anything for a week

484
0:43:22,120000 --> 0:43:26,760000
That muscle mass reserve is going to decline much faster than it would in one of us

485
0:43:27 --> 0:43:29
So

486
0:43:29 --> 0:43:34,520000
They may regain that lost weight and when they regain that lost weight they're going to have increased fat mass

487
0:43:35,160000 --> 0:43:41,400000
So they never gain back the muscle mass that they lost and again unless you're very intentional with that

488
0:43:41,880000 --> 0:43:47,640000
They're also going to see a decrease in muscle mass and the muscle mass that they if they gain muscle mass back

489
0:43:47,720000 --> 0:43:51,800000
And it wasn't intentionally planned for its poor quality muscle mass

490
0:43:51,960000 --> 0:43:55
So they may have muscle mass but it's not the same quality

491
0:43:55,160000 --> 0:43:58,920000
And part of the thought is that we have increased fat mass going into those strals

492
0:43:59 --> 0:44:03,960000
Skeletal muscles which we talked about a little bit earlier and that leads to sarcopenic obesity

493
0:44:05,720000 --> 0:44:11,560000
So what are the concerns associated with sarcopenic obesity? There's decreased mobility and functionality

494
0:44:11,640000 --> 0:44:17,480000
Which again if you're decreasing muscle mass and increasing fat mass that goes with it decreased aerobic capacity

495
0:44:17,960000 --> 0:44:20,680000
Um, and that leads to earlier onset disability

496
0:44:21,800000 --> 0:44:26,680000
And increased risk for falls and increased risk for frailty all of those together again

497
0:44:27,640000 --> 0:44:34,280000
That is not just thinking that i've got a sarcopenic obese patient now i may have worse complications from the weight loss than i had if i've

498
0:44:34,760000 --> 0:44:36,760000
Left it along so to speak

499
0:44:37,560000 --> 0:44:42,440000
We can screen for sarcopenia. Um, you can do the hand grip test that's very subjective

500
0:44:42,920000 --> 0:44:47,960000
Having a patient just grip in the clinic. The more objective measure is the donnaumemometry

501
0:44:48,360000 --> 0:44:55
Um, and so the patient's grips device that tells grip strength and you can compare it to norms for age and gender

502
0:44:55,560000 --> 0:44:59,800000
Um, with that and then you can do a tug test which doesn't require any device

503
0:44:59,880000 --> 0:45:06,520000
They walk 10 feet turn around and walk back any score of greater than 12 seconds is an increased risk for falls

504
0:45:06,520000 --> 0:45:08,520000
Which is an indicator for sarcopenia

505
0:45:09,080000 --> 0:45:15
There's also a screening tool considered the SARC F questionnaire. There's five domains they ask questions about

506
0:45:15,800000 --> 0:45:19,480000
Um, can you lift and hold 10 pounds of something?

507
0:45:19,880000 --> 0:45:22,840000
Can you get up and walk across a room?

508
0:45:23,400000 --> 0:45:25,640000
Can you rise from a chair or rise from a bed?

509
0:45:26,280000 --> 0:45:31,880000
Um, can you climb stairs a flight of 10 stairs and then how many falls have you had in the last month?

510
0:45:32,360000 --> 0:45:35,080000
Um, the higher the score the worse the outcome

511
0:45:35,480000 --> 0:45:39,560000
Um, and so a score greater than or equal to four is predictive of sarcopenia

512
0:45:39,560000 --> 0:45:46,040000
All right, so which of the following older adults is the best candidate for a weight loss intervention?

513
0:46:10,120000 --> 0:46:11,560000
So

514
0:46:11,560000 --> 0:46:17,720000
See is the best answer and we'll talk a little bit more about why but the BMI greater than 30

515
0:46:18,200000 --> 0:46:23,160000
Um, is going to be one of the first things that we talked about that's a higher risk the lower BMI's

516
0:46:23,160000 --> 0:46:30,040000
We're not going to want to initiate weight loss yet and they have metabolic concerns with the diabetes and the coronary artery disease

517
0:46:30,680000 --> 0:46:35,560000
Um, and that's what the god there is one god one that addresses weight loss in older adults

518
0:46:35,720000 --> 0:46:42,120000
All the ones that mortis talked about earlier. They don't address weight loss in older adults. This is a european god line

519
0:46:42,600000 --> 0:46:49,480000
Um that focuses on nutrition and so um, they recommend a BMI greater than 30 with metabolic

520
0:46:49,640000 --> 0:46:53,160000
Derangements or they begin to have functional impairments due to their obesity

521
0:46:53,640000 --> 0:46:57,480000
But the key is that we avoid muscle and bone loss in those patients

522
0:46:58,120000 --> 0:47:01,800000
So which of the following weight loss interventions does Medicare cover?

523
0:47:02,280000 --> 0:47:05,720000
Mm-hmm, right so fun

524
0:47:18,600000 --> 0:47:20,760000
So the correct answer that you guys chose

525
0:47:23,960000 --> 0:47:27,640000
Is intensive behavioral therapy for those of the BMI greater than 30

526
0:47:28,280000 --> 0:47:30,760000
They do not cover dietary services by a dietitian

527
0:47:31,560000 --> 0:47:33,560000
They cover two services they cover

528
0:47:34,120000 --> 0:47:40,680000
intensive behavioral therapy done by a primary care physician or primary care provider in a primary care setting

529
0:47:41,320000 --> 0:47:46,520000
And they cover bariatric surgery if you have a BMI greater than 35 with an underlying medical condition

530
0:47:47 --> 0:47:50,680000
Less than 1% of Medicare beneficiaries take advantage of those two

531
0:47:51,560000 --> 0:47:53,080000
services

532
0:47:53,080000 --> 0:47:59,240000
What's not covered counseling by a dietitian counseling by a psychologist for weight loss interventions

533
0:47:59,640000 --> 0:48:06,440000
Weight loss programs meal delivery cosmetic procedures and anti obesity medications because it predates an act

534
0:48:06,920000 --> 0:48:08,920000
to Medicare part D and where

535
0:48:08,920000 --> 0:48:13,480000
Drugs were considered cosmetic rather than for cardiovascular benefits like mortises highlighted

536
0:48:14,280000 --> 0:48:16,360000
the european society of clinical and medic

537
0:48:16,920000 --> 0:48:18,760000
Nutrition and metabolism

538
0:48:18,760000 --> 0:48:24,520000
Does not endorse weight loss and overweight which that fits with what we kind of solve from the morbidity and mortality standpoint

539
0:48:24,920000 --> 0:48:29,400000
But they do say consider it an obese patients with health related problems

540
0:48:29,800000 --> 0:48:35,400000
If you can consider the risk versus benefit so it's always again going back to risk versus benefits in that patient population

541
0:48:36,920000 --> 0:48:42,200000
So what do the aspen guidelines recommend are the best dietary parameters for weight loss and an obese older adult?

542
0:48:42,200000 --> 0:48:44,200000
So

543
0:48:51,720000 --> 0:48:58,920000
The best answer for this one is going to be that they have a calorie restriction of no more than 500

544
0:48:58,920000 --> 0:49:03,320000
Kilocalories of what's required per day and they need at least one gram of protein

545
0:49:04,360000 --> 0:49:07,640000
Perky low per day. That's a lot of protein and older adult

546
0:49:07,720000 --> 0:49:12,680000
I don't know how if y'all tracked that but that's a lot and then if they have

547
0:49:13,140000 --> 0:49:14,520000
Ordentition

548
0:49:14,520000 --> 0:49:21,320000
That's even harder to get that protein in and as we age our sweet sensation or sweet taste buds

549
0:49:22,040000 --> 0:49:26,120000
prevail over our savory taste buds. So again, we have problems getting that protein in

550
0:49:26,760000 --> 0:49:29,320000
Um with that, but we do need to sure adequate

551
0:49:29,560000 --> 0:49:36,120000
Macro and micronutrients in our patients because we don't want to have malnutrition from extensive caloric restriction

552
0:49:36,520000 --> 0:49:42,520000
The target weight loss is around 5 to 10 percent of their initial body weight over six months

553
0:49:42,840000 --> 0:49:45,880000
So we're talking about a very slow and steady weight loss

554
0:49:46,760000 --> 0:49:49,240000
Some of my patients are not happy with that

555
0:49:49,800000 --> 0:49:54,280000
Um, so if you think about like our young old or our old old

556
0:49:55,160000 --> 0:49:58,200000
They are boomers that went through the diet fads in the 80s

557
0:49:59 --> 0:50:02,360000
And so weight loss to them is you lose a bunch

558
0:50:02,920000 --> 0:50:07,720000
And then you stop whatever you're doing it may come back and then we go back because that's what we did in the 80s

559
0:50:07,880000 --> 0:50:12,360000
Unfortunately, we had horrible dietary approaches for weight loss in the 80s

560
0:50:12,680000 --> 0:50:19
And so it's getting them to understand slow and steady is how we want to approach this and it's not going to be quick

561
0:50:20,280000 --> 0:50:27,240000
The other piece that always needs to be with any caloric restriction or any other intervention for weight loss is

562
0:50:27,960000 --> 0:50:34,760000
That we have exercises to component intentional built-in weight loss that includes both aerobic resistance and balance

563
0:50:35,160000 --> 0:50:41,400000
With probably the greatest emphasis on resistance because we want to build or maintain that muscle mass in those patients

564
0:50:43,240000 --> 0:50:46,840000
So mortis has covered the drug therapy and I will not rehash

565
0:50:47,400000 --> 0:50:52,280000
What she has covered, but I do want to talk about the positive data in our older adults

566
0:50:52,600000 --> 0:50:57,400000
Which that's not a surprise for those of you who care for older adults and follow the literature

567
0:50:57,400000 --> 0:51:01
We have a lot of things that don't have a lot of data behind it, but this is

568
0:51:01,880000 --> 0:51:11,080000
Like very small amount. So with the sglt2 is less than 10 percent of weight loss trial participants were greater than 65 years of age

569
0:51:12,280000 --> 0:51:18,120000
And so again limited but probably some of the better data that we have in older adults

570
0:51:18,680000 --> 0:51:22,840000
Um, the concerns here with this in older adults are that decreased in appetite

571
0:51:23,320000 --> 0:51:26,120000
And mortis talked about like it should be transient within a month

572
0:51:26,200000 --> 0:51:33,160000
But if it's not in our older adults and they have a decreased appetite remember we just talked about we've got to ensure that they have adequate

573
0:51:33,640000 --> 0:51:38,040000
Intake especially a protein in other macromicro nutrients

574
0:51:38,440000 --> 0:51:43,720000
If they're to the point that they're refusing to eat or they're barely having the adequate caloric intake they need

575
0:51:44,200000 --> 0:51:46,680000
We may have to stop these agents in those patients

576
0:51:47,080000 --> 0:51:50,040000
Um, the other piece that we have to worry about is hypoglycemia

577
0:51:50,520000 --> 0:51:56,360000
Um, I'm speaking to a group of pharmacists. So y'all all know hypoglycemia in older adults is bad always bad

578
0:51:56,760000 --> 0:52:01,640000
Um, and so we need to again air on the side of what are our concerns there for that

579
0:52:02,040000 --> 0:52:05,720000
Um, and if they're having any of that again, these agents may have to be stopped

580
0:52:06,440000 --> 0:52:11,720000
And then all older adults continuously have concerns and issues with constipation

581
0:52:11,720000 --> 0:52:18,120000
So if we're making that worse, we're going to need to um, think about that as maybe a reason not to use these agents

582
0:52:19,320000 --> 0:52:25
Ptersepthetide actually had about 30% of participants that were greater than 65 years of age

583
0:52:25,080000 --> 0:52:29,800000
But as we look at the old old less than 4% were greater than 75

584
0:52:30,120000 --> 0:52:34,360000
So we don't again have good data in that older adult population that's

585
0:52:35,560000 --> 0:52:37,560000
Above the young old

586
0:52:37,880000 --> 0:52:41,720000
Um, I didn't talk about injections in those concerns with the previous one but

587
0:52:42,200000 --> 0:52:45,640000
Concerns with older adults do they have the dexterity to be able to do the injection?

588
0:52:46,120000 --> 0:52:49,640000
And do they have the vision to be able to dial to be able to see that?

589
0:52:49,960000 --> 0:52:52,120000
I think sometimes again, we may discount that

590
0:52:52,520000 --> 0:52:57,080000
Especially if they're at home if they have caregivers that can ease that concern with that

591
0:52:59,960000 --> 0:53:01,960000
So with now track zone and be appropriate on

592
0:53:02,520000 --> 0:53:07,560000
Um, less than 2% of trial participants were greater than 65 and none were over 75

593
0:53:07,640000 --> 0:53:09,640000
So again, we have a very

594
0:53:10,280000 --> 0:53:16,200000
Small amount of data in our older adult patient populations. Lord has highlighted a lot of the drug interactions

595
0:53:16,920000 --> 0:53:18,680000
That are older adults again

596
0:53:18,680000 --> 0:53:22,600000
I'm speaking with pharmacists so you know our drug list are long in our older adults

597
0:53:22,680000 --> 0:53:26,920000
The potential for drug interactions is huge in this patient population with these agents

598
0:53:27,320000 --> 0:53:30,520000
And a lot of these older adults with obesity are going to have chronic pain

599
0:53:30,600000 --> 0:53:36,680000
So they would have a greater propensity for opiates that we have to be concerned about negating that effect with an L-trach zone

600
0:53:37,320000 --> 0:53:44,520000
Um, another one I'd like to highlight here from a side effect profile is the neuropsychiatric disturbances and suicidal ideations

601
0:53:45 --> 0:53:47,400000
Um, our older adults are more prone to those

602
0:53:47,960000 --> 0:53:54,200000
And so we would increase that risk exponentially in our older adults compared to a younger and middle age population

603
0:53:54,600000 --> 0:53:59,320000
And then again increased heart rate and increased blood pressure in our older adults is never a good thing

604
0:54:00,280000 --> 0:54:02,440000
In our older adults typically always

605
0:54:03,080000 --> 0:54:05,880000
Um, not always but have higher rates of insomnia

606
0:54:06,200000 --> 0:54:09,400000
Primarily because it changes in the REM cycle sleep cycle for them

607
0:54:09,640000 --> 0:54:13,160000
And so we do have to be concerned with that insomnia being worsened in them

608
0:54:14,920000 --> 0:54:19,560000
Finteremin, I'll just say it should not be used in older adults ever

609
0:54:20,440000 --> 0:54:21,640000
Um

610
0:54:21,640000 --> 0:54:24,920000
7% of the clinical trial participants were greater than 65

611
0:54:25,400000 --> 0:54:29,560000
But the risk and mortise went over those risks so well, so I won't belabor those but

612
0:54:30,120000 --> 0:54:36,760000
It is significant increased risk in our older adults and oftentimes will be contraindicated in that patient population

613
0:54:37,880000 --> 0:54:40,840000
And then if you add to a pyramid to it, it just makes it a little bit

614
0:54:41,320000 --> 0:54:46,840000
Yes works would be the right word for that. Um, so again this one would be contraindicated

615
0:54:47,240000 --> 0:54:51,880000
Um, 7% of trial participants were 60 to 69 none were over 70

616
0:54:51,880000 --> 0:54:54,120000
So we really can't assess safety in these patients

617
0:54:54,120000 --> 0:54:58,520000
But what little bit we know about it the risk would be and you see your drug list for

618
0:54:59,160000 --> 0:55:04,440000
Drug interactions increases as we added to pyramid we have increased risk for hyperkignea

619
0:55:04,440000 --> 0:55:07,800000
That's never good in an older adult. They're probably going to be on a diuretic

620
0:55:08,360000 --> 0:55:11,400000
Um in some capacity for the heart failure of the blood pressure

621
0:55:11,800000 --> 0:55:17,560000
Um and will worsen cognitive dysfunction and our older adults don't need any help with that worsening cognitive dysfunction

622
0:55:18,440000 --> 0:55:20,440000
With orla stat

623
0:55:20,440000 --> 0:55:24,920000
Because that study was done so early on we didn't track age for those greater than 65

624
0:55:24,920000 --> 0:55:30,200000
So there may have been patients in there, but I couldn't find any data on the use of that in patients over 65

625
0:55:30,600000 --> 0:55:32,760000
Lourdes highlighted the drug interactions again

626
0:55:33 --> 0:55:35,560000
That's going to be a big one to think about in our older adults

627
0:55:35,640000 --> 0:55:39,640000
Especially if we do have someone or a war friend and then they'll leave up our oxen administration

628
0:55:40,040000 --> 0:55:44,760000
Our older adults already have a harder time with separation of things that was going to make it that much harder

629
0:55:45,320000 --> 0:55:50,280000
Um, and then we will have the fecal incontinence and again think about an older adult

630
0:55:50,280000 --> 0:55:54,360000
That's already struggling with adls and we had thinkful incontinence on top of that

631
0:55:54,760000 --> 0:55:59,240000
They may have a hard time with that compared to again a younger patient population

632
0:56:00,520000 --> 0:56:07,800000
So some key takeaways before we get to some of the fun part for today are that being overweight and older adults actually considered

633
0:56:08,280000 --> 0:56:12,280000
Protective and reduces mortality risk compared to a lower or higher BMI

634
0:56:13,240000 --> 0:56:16,680000
The greatest risk to weight loss in older adults are functional muscle loss

635
0:56:17,160000 --> 0:56:19,960000
Bone loss and the development of that sarcopenic obesity

636
0:56:20,600000 --> 0:56:23,480000
Medicare partner doesn't cover any weight loss medications

637
0:56:24,040000 --> 0:56:29,720000
And there's very limited efficacy and safety data available for the use of weight loss medications in our older adults

638
0:56:31,240000 --> 0:56:35,640000
Weight loss interventions should be considered for older adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 30

639
0:56:36,040000 --> 0:56:39,320000
That have metabolic derangements or have functional impairments

640
0:56:40,120000 --> 0:56:43,720000
But both muscle and bone loss needs to be avoided in those patients

641
0:56:43,800000 --> 0:56:46,760000
So again a very intentional plan on how you're going to approach that

642
0:56:47,400000 --> 0:56:53,880000
And then weight loss interventions involving caloric restriction and medications are both they absolutely need to have an exercise regimen

643
0:56:53,960000 --> 0:56:58,360000
And that's a hard sell for our some of our older adults that are already having mobility issues

644
0:56:59,320000 --> 0:57:02,520000
With that i'm going to turn it over to lordis to get us started on the fun part

645
0:57:02,520000 --> 0:57:10,200000
All right, so who all here is familiar with an escape room?

646
0:57:11,320000 --> 0:57:15,800000
I think they've gotten popular over the years. Um, so now we have a case to escape

647
0:57:16,360000 --> 0:57:18,840000
Related to some of the information that we covered today

648
0:57:19,240000 --> 0:57:23,320000
So if you have your laptop or your phone should work on either device

649
0:57:23,880000 --> 0:57:30,120000
Go ahead and go to this link tinyurl.com slash ashp dash a om

650
0:57:30,680000 --> 0:57:32,120000
And

651
0:57:32,120000 --> 0:57:38,120000
So what we are going to do is to have you all try to escape out of this room by solving

652
0:57:38,520000 --> 0:57:41,160000
Um, the case as well as answering a couple of questions

653
0:57:41,480000 --> 0:57:46,040000
We'll be walking around the room making sure there's no like technical issues and kind of guiding you along

654
0:57:46,440000 --> 0:57:53,800000
Um, and then we'll reconvene in about 15 minutes to discuss the case as well as open up for q&a

655
0:57:54,360000 --> 0:57:58,280000
So with that being said go ahead and work with each other and try to solve the case

656
0:58:00,120000 --> 0:58:02,120000
So

657
0:58:30,120000 --> 0:58:32,120000
So

658
0:59:00,120000 --> 0:59:02,120000
So

659
0:59:30,120000 --> 0:59:32,120000
So

660
1:00:00,120000 --> 1:00:02,120000
So

661
1:00:30,120000 --> 1:00:32,120000
So

662
1:01:00,120000 --> 1:01:02,120000
So

663
1:01:30,120000 --> 1:01:32,120000
So

664
1:02:00,120000 --> 1:02:02,120000
So

665
1:02:30,120000 --> 1:02:32,120000
So

666
1:03:00,120000 --> 1:03:02,120000
So

667
1:03:30,120000 --> 1:03:32,120000
So

668
1:04:00,120000 --> 1:04:02,120000
So

669
1:04:30,120000 --> 1:04:32,120000
So

670
1:05:00,120000 --> 1:05:02,120000
So

671
1:05:30,120000 --> 1:05:32,120000
So

672
1:06:00,120000 --> 1:06:02,120000
So

673
1:06:02,120000 --> 1:06:04,120000
So

674
1:06:04,120000 --> 1:06:06,120000
So

675
1:06:06,120000 --> 1:06:08,120000
So

676
1:06:08,120000 --> 1:06:10,120000
So

677
1:06:10,120000 --> 1:06:12,120000
So

678
1:06:12,120000 --> 1:06:14,120000
So

679
1:06:14,120000 --> 1:06:16,120000
So

680
1:06:16,120000 --> 1:06:18,120000
So

681
1:06:18,120000 --> 1:06:20,120000
So

682
1:06:20,120000 --> 1:06:36,120000
All right, so I guess we'll go ahead and reconvene i've seen a lot of successful certificates out there in solving the case

683
1:06:36,120000 --> 1:06:42,120000
Which is awesome. Um, I love using this program to make escape rooms also use it in the classroom

684
1:06:42,120000 --> 1:06:46,040000
So it's a really cool way to tie in patient cases. And that being said

685
1:06:46,920000 --> 1:06:52,120000
We'll go ahead and highlight some key things with this case. So in terms of the first two questions

686
1:06:52,520000 --> 1:06:55,800000
What is preferred method for assessing sarcopenia and an older adult?

687
1:06:55,800000 --> 1:06:59,800000
The answer is not in the mama tree here and then as far as second question

688
1:06:59,800000 --> 1:07:03,400000
Which patient would be the best candidate for waste loss intervention?

689
1:07:03,880000 --> 1:07:07,480000
So in this case tying in all that information we talked about earlier

690
1:07:07,800000 --> 1:07:13,320000
It's the 74 year old female with the BMI 30 in a history of type 2 diabetes

691
1:07:13,880000 --> 1:07:17
Now going into the main case for this particular patient

692
1:07:17,640000 --> 1:07:19,640000
We have an older adult

693
1:07:19,640000 --> 1:07:24,440000
And kind of clicking around there. So she is essentially struggling to lose weight

694
1:07:24,920000 --> 1:07:29,960000
And so we want to definitely take a look at her past medical history her vile signs

695
1:07:30,760000 --> 1:07:36,920000
Coorbidities to see what would be the best weight loss management solution for this patient

696
1:07:37,400000 --> 1:07:39,400000
I'm now from that escape room standpoint

697
1:07:39,880000 --> 1:07:47,080000
Our goal here is to unlock this door and there are some questions that you had to seek out in order to find the code to that

698
1:07:47,640000 --> 1:07:50,040000
Um, so to highlight some things with this patient

699
1:07:50,920000 --> 1:07:52,920000
We have her medical list here

700
1:07:53,320000 --> 1:07:56,840000
Similar to of our practice questions from earlier she is on tram at all

701
1:07:57,400000 --> 1:08:02,440000
As well as a long list of other medications, but that's going to tie in later some

702
1:08:03,560000 --> 1:08:10,760000
Vital signs the point out here her BMI is again 30 blood pressure is elevated at 165 over 90

703
1:08:11,160000 --> 1:08:13,160000
heart rate of 100

704
1:08:13,880000 --> 1:08:15,880000
and then looking at her

705
1:08:16,680000 --> 1:08:18,680000
Other information here

706
1:08:18,920000 --> 1:08:20,920000
So some of this

707
1:08:20,920000 --> 1:08:25
Not directly pertains to some of the answer choices whenever we get to the questions

708
1:08:25,080000 --> 1:08:28,120000
But more so for just the completion of information

709
1:08:28,840000 --> 1:08:33,720000
And then we have her labs and a medical history listed as well

710
1:08:35,640000 --> 1:08:37,720000
So that being said

711
1:08:37,720000 --> 1:08:42,200000
The key here was to go to the cabinet to unlock the three questions to solve the case

712
1:08:42,600000 --> 1:08:44,600000
So going with the first question

713
1:08:45,080000 --> 1:08:48,360000
What weight loss treatment benefits does she qualify for under Medicare?

714
1:08:48,360000 --> 1:08:51,400000
So they're really highlighted that there aren't really a lot of good

715
1:08:52,120000 --> 1:09:01,480000
Benefits for our older adult hip population. Um, so in this case predominantly intensive behavioral therapy is the one that she qualifies for

716
1:09:03,080000 --> 1:09:07,800000
Now going into our second question was a potential issue associated with a medication

717
1:09:08,520000 --> 1:09:10,520000
If prescribed for Sally

718
1:09:10,520000 --> 1:09:14,120000
Um, so again, um in this case a couple of things to consider

719
1:09:14,680000 --> 1:09:18,840000
With fentermine so because of her elevated blood pressure

720
1:09:19,320000 --> 1:09:24,840000
The answer for this is D that's not appropriate to be used in this patient

721
1:09:28,280000 --> 1:09:32,920000
And then to our last question what treatment plan is most appropriate to initiate for Sally

722
1:09:33,320000 --> 1:09:38,200000
Um, so in this case our GLP one kind of highlighting those benefits there

723
1:09:38,600000 --> 1:09:42,440000
Um, so with it having good weight loss efficacy, there's no contraindication

724
1:09:43 --> 1:09:46,120000
In this patient to use that whereas with our other agents

725
1:09:46,680000 --> 1:09:52,520000
Either a decreased efficacy or again, um because of that elevated blood pressure some issues there

726
1:09:54,440000 --> 1:09:58,280000
So if you were to go to the door and to unlock it

727
1:09:58,920000 --> 1:10:03,800000
Um, all lowercase BDE that would lead to your certificate of completion

728
1:10:04,120000 --> 1:10:08,920000
So again, saw a lot of certificates out there. Um, really great job in solving that case

729
1:10:10,040000 --> 1:10:14,120000
That being said we are going to wrap up this presentation and

730
1:10:14,840000 --> 1:10:16,840000
Open up for q&a

731
1:10:18,360000 --> 1:10:20,360000
And thank you all for participating

732
1:10:28,520000 --> 1:10:31,320000
Okay, all right, um, so kind of looking at some of these questions here

733
1:10:31,800000 --> 1:10:37,560000
Um, so like to see us publish on time. I absolutely totally missed that until I was just informed because it changes so rapidly

734
1:10:37,880000 --> 1:10:41,720000
Um, so that's awesome. Um, really good news with that particular trial

735
1:10:42,040000 --> 1:10:46,680000
Um, recommendation on the suicide risk flag. So I think that definitely is kind of on our radar

736
1:10:47 --> 1:10:50,920000
To kind of look at closely, you know across the board with like these weight loss medications

737
1:10:51,320000 --> 1:10:53,320000
And we are concerned for some of those

738
1:10:53,320000 --> 1:10:55,400000
Um, you know, suicide risk changes

739
1:10:55,800000 --> 1:10:59
Um in mood and whatnot. So definitely something that we are, you know

740
1:10:59,560000 --> 1:11:04,440000
In essence kind of keeping a close tab on, um, as we're initiating these drugs

741
1:11:05,720000 --> 1:11:10,840000
Um, as far as specific recommendations for contraception using GLP ones and patients as a child

742
1:11:11,240000 --> 1:11:18,040000
During age, um, so definitely because of potential interaction when using, um, contraception

743
1:11:18,520000 --> 1:11:25,880000
Um, you know, I don't know exact specifics on what to recommend as far as, um, you know, I had a management that again

744
1:11:25,880000 --> 1:11:28,440000
I think it's also something to keep into consideration

745
1:11:28,920000 --> 1:11:32,680000
Uh, you know, potentially like decreasing the efficacy for like oral contraceptives

746
1:11:33,240000 --> 1:11:35,240000
When we're giving those

747
1:11:35,480000 --> 1:11:40,600000
Together and as far as your experience of patient responses when told they need to be on therapy long

748
1:11:40,920000 --> 1:11:43,320000
Term most of my patients love the weight loss

749
1:11:44,120000 --> 1:11:46,840000
Pointing like they're very excited with the results that they're seeing

750
1:11:47,400000 --> 1:11:52,840000
Uh, especially with their injectable agents. Um, and that is a big motivator for them that they are seeing these really good

751
1:11:53,160000 --> 1:11:55,320000
benefits associated with them

752
1:11:59,640000 --> 1:12:01,640000
Oh 17

753
1:12:05,640000 --> 1:12:07,640000
Hi guys, I just have one question, um

754
1:12:07,640000 --> 1:12:09,640000
I'm sorry

755
1:12:09,640000 --> 1:12:14,040000
Um, and maybe the rest of the people in the room can help me because I feel like everyone's doing the same thing

756
1:12:14,600000 --> 1:12:21,960000
Um, the compounded semaglutite is all over everywhere. Um, and I'm curious how everyone's handling that

757
1:12:22,440000 --> 1:12:29,240000
Um, I'm obviously not recommending its use, but obviously people go to their non PCPs to get this everywhere

758
1:12:29,720000 --> 1:12:31,720000
Um, has anybody found any like

759
1:12:32,200000 --> 1:12:37,080000
Actual like legitimate issues, um, with it outside, you know, semaglutite

760
1:12:37,640000 --> 1:12:42,600000
Semaglutite is semaglutite. Um, so it's just a larger conversation, but

761
1:12:43,480000 --> 1:12:49,480000
Right. Yeah, I think absolutely we are seeing that compound being more available because of the popularity of these drugs

762
1:12:49,640000 --> 1:12:53,720000
Um, I think that's just kind of like the big unknown. We don't have a lot of good data on

763
1:12:54,120000 --> 1:13:00,760000
Um, is it effective by soft thumbs down earlier however here? I mean, I think in general we definitely want to be cautious because there isn't really good guidance

764
1:13:01,400000 --> 1:13:04,040000
In terms of, you know, using that type of

765
1:13:05 --> 1:13:07
formulation

766
1:13:08,280000 --> 1:13:14,840000
And then a follow up question I got for compound is semaglutite. Um, obviously ozempic for weight loss

767
1:13:15,480000 --> 1:13:17,480000
Um, is off label use

768
1:13:19,960000 --> 1:13:21,960000
How are systems handling that?

769
1:13:22,680000 --> 1:13:28,040000
Um, because I've got some providers who are like, no, I don't use anything off label and others are like, oh, semaglutite is semaglutite

770
1:13:28,040000 --> 1:13:30,440000
And so we'll just use it because I can get it easier than the weight loss

771
1:13:30,840000 --> 1:13:37,080000
Yes, so for using like ozempic for the weight loss benefit. So yes in trials. We are still seeing right, um, weight loss benefits

772
1:13:37,080000 --> 1:13:40,840000
The biggest thing you're on to is like insurance coverage, which especially in my clinic

773
1:13:40,840000 --> 1:13:47,800000
That's how we try to get around is like, oh, they have diabetes like, you know, they're that close. We'll put it down for coverage

774
1:13:48,200000 --> 1:13:51,560000
Um, but yes, I mean we are still seeing the efficacy

775
1:13:52,360000 --> 1:13:56,680000
With it, um, without you know having that official FDA approval

776
1:13:57,080000 --> 1:14:02,440000
Um, so we still tried to use it if we're going to get that added weight loss in our patients with diabetes

777
1:14:07,080000 --> 1:14:09,080000
So

778
1:14:28,200000 --> 1:14:34,360000
So you can still see again talk about like your lane muscle mass decreases by that 40% between 20 and 70

779
1:14:34,360000 --> 1:14:40,040000
So I think you would still see that loss. We just may not see it as profoundly as we see in our older adults

780
1:14:47,560000 --> 1:14:49,560000
Have another question

781
1:14:49,560000 --> 1:14:53,560000
Oh, no, actually there's a question in their iPhone interesting, uh, Kristi Schumacher

782
1:14:53,960000 --> 1:14:59,480000
There's um, we see that sometimes decreases in levotharoxin dose when you start a GOP one. Do you guys see that a lot?

783
1:15:00,280000 --> 1:15:03,320000
There was a question in there about dose adjusting centroid

784
1:15:05,160000 --> 1:15:07,160000
Um, Jupy one

785
1:15:07,480000 --> 1:15:12,680000
Because they lose so much weight then they require less levotharoxin. Do you guys see that a lot in clinical practice?

786
1:15:13,240000 --> 1:15:18,280000
Yeah, personally, I haven't seen that as much but yes, I think for a physiological perspective

787
1:15:18,840000 --> 1:15:20,840000
I haven't seen it, but we don't use it

788
1:15:21,320000 --> 1:15:23,640000
In our older adults now in our family practice

789
1:15:23,960000 --> 1:15:29,320000
Maybe but I work in an indigent clinic. So use of those drugs is pretty limited in my clinic

790
1:15:29,720000 --> 1:15:32,840000
So I'm gonna say I'm pretty skewed on that to not be able to call me

791
1:15:33,320000 --> 1:15:35,800000
Okay, I saw if there's more questions in your chat

792
1:15:35,880000 --> 1:15:40,040000
I thought that one was interesting because we've had to adjust levotharoxin a couple of times and lower the dose

793
1:15:40,520000 --> 1:15:43,320000
Um, we do a lot of diabetes and it was something so yeah

794
1:15:49,560000 --> 1:15:53,880000
All right, well, thank you all so much for attending this session
