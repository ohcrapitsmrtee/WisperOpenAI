Beth Redmond spoke to me today regarding a CT scan that showed hernia, which she needs

2
0:00:09,120000 --> 0:00:21
repaired, and some air in her lungs, or the lungs are collapsed, or at least somewhere

3
0:00:21 --> 0:00:34,280000
in the left, right, left, right, mid-lobe, because she is concerned about the warning

4
0:00:34,280000 --> 0:00:39,800000
on the squally packet about interstitial lung disease, and pneumonitis.

5
0:00:39,800000 --> 0:00:49,560000
Hyphin and I spoke to her that various different causes for this can happen, such as she had

6
0:00:49,560000 --> 0:00:56,360000
RSV in last year, in August, and was treated with antibiotics, and some of the remnants

7
0:00:56,360000 --> 0:01:02,800000
of that, or potentially pneumonia, causing a plug can cause a collapse lung, or a pulmonary

8
0:01:02,800000 --> 0:01:09,840000
embersome, but tried to calm her down saying that that usually happens when patients are

9
0:01:09,840000 --> 0:01:19,200000
stationary or immobile for a long period of time, and that she wouldn't be able to tolerate

10
0:01:19,200000 --> 0:01:27,080000
the intensity of pain level if it did happen, so she seemed to see a medical attention.

11
0:01:27,080000 --> 0:01:34,760000
I then said that given that the interstitial lung disease hasn't been rolled out, that

12
0:01:34,760000 --> 0:01:44,640000
she needs to talk to the doctor, and that she needs to hold off the dose of medication

13
0:01:44,640000 --> 0:01:45,800000
until the meeting.

14
0:01:45,800000 --> 0:01:53,440000
Here, the doctor will decide if they need to do steroids, lower the dose, or some other

15
0:01:53,440000 --> 0:01:55,560000
referrals if necessary.
