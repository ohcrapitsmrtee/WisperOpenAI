1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:02,880000
All right, good afternoon everyone.

2
0:00:02,880000 --> 0:00:04,880000
Thank you so much for choosing to be here with us

3
0:00:04,880000 --> 0:00:07,200000
for our presentation titled Changing the Way

4
0:00:07,200000 --> 0:00:09,400000
Patients' Access Reproductive Health.

5
0:00:09,400000 --> 0:00:10,640000
My name is Jordan Clunen.

6
0:00:10,640000 --> 0:00:14,240000
I am currently a PGY2 ambulatory care pharmacy resident

7
0:00:14,240000 --> 0:00:17,600000
at the Metro Health System located in Cleveland, Ohio.

8
0:00:17,600000 --> 0:00:21
I also have the privilege of introducing my colleagues here,

9
0:00:21 --> 0:00:22,280000
my fellow presenters.

10
0:00:22,280000 --> 0:00:24,360000
I will first start with Dr. King.

11
0:00:24,360000 --> 0:00:27,160000
Dr. King is an ambulatory care pharmacy specialist

12
0:00:27,160000 --> 0:00:29
who practices at Metro Health System,

13
0:00:29 --> 0:00:30,720000
also in Cleveland, Ohio.

14
0:00:30,720000 --> 0:00:32,880000
Dr. King is also an associate professor

15
0:00:32,880000 --> 0:00:36,440000
at the Northeast Ohio Medical University College of Pharmacy,

16
0:00:36,440000 --> 0:00:39,840000
and she has focused her research both on ambulatory care,

17
0:00:39,840000 --> 0:00:41,640000
as well as in women's health.

18
0:00:41,640000 --> 0:00:44,080000
It is also my honor to recognize and to introduce

19
0:00:44,080000 --> 0:00:47,680000
Dr. Lorenda Anderson, who is a clinical associate professor

20
0:00:47,680000 --> 0:00:50,760000
at the Oregon State University College of Pharmacy.

21
0:00:50,760000 --> 0:00:52,760000
Her research and advocacy efforts focus on

22
0:00:52,760000 --> 0:00:54,680000
pharmacist prescribed contraception,

23
0:00:54,680000 --> 0:00:56,600000
where she serves on Oregon State committees

24
0:00:56,600000 --> 0:00:59,600000
to develop as well as maintain the statewide protocol.

25
0:00:59,600000 --> 0:01:04,040000
None of the authors or the presenters

26
0:01:04,040000 --> 0:01:07,840000
of this presentation have anything to disclose.

27
0:01:07,840000 --> 0:01:09,720000
In listed here, you'll find our learning objectives

28
0:01:09,720000 --> 0:01:10,880000
for this afternoon.

29
0:01:10,880000 --> 0:01:13,640000
I will allow you to go through them on your own time

30
0:01:13,640000 --> 0:01:17,640000
and refer to them as needed throughout the presentation.

31
0:01:17,640000 --> 0:01:20,720000
We also wanted to provide for you a list of definitions,

32
0:01:20,720000 --> 0:01:22,800000
as well as commonly used abbreviations,

33
0:01:22,800000 --> 0:01:25,240000
not only that will be used throughout this presentation,

34
0:01:25,240000 --> 0:01:28,120000
but also that are routinely used in clinical practice,

35
0:01:28,120000 --> 0:01:30,960000
so it would be in your best interest to try to familiarize

36
0:01:30,960000 --> 0:01:33,560000
yourself with these abbreviations,

37
0:01:33,560000 --> 0:01:34,880000
again, throughout the presentation

38
0:01:34,880000 --> 0:01:37
and in clinical practice, as well.

39
0:01:37 --> 0:01:39,040000
I also wanted to mention that at this time,

40
0:01:39,040000 --> 0:01:41,160000
if you plan to participate in our cases

41
0:01:41,160000 --> 0:01:42,440000
throughout our presentation,

42
0:01:42,440000 --> 0:01:45,480000
that if you could please try to download the slide set now,

43
0:01:45,480000 --> 0:01:47,560000
because the cases are located at the end,

44
0:01:47,560000 --> 0:01:50,560000
and we will be referring to them throughout the presentation.

45
0:01:50,560000 --> 0:01:54,560000
And so to jump right in, we wanted to start with

46
0:01:54,560000 --> 0:01:56,600000
what is going to show you the global oral

47
0:01:56,600000 --> 0:02:00,400000
contraception availability throughout the entire globe.

48
0:02:00,400000 --> 0:02:03
So as you can see here, we have in red,

49
0:02:03 --> 0:02:05,920000
what some might consider to be more developed countries

50
0:02:05,920000 --> 0:02:08,840000
such as United States, we see Canada on there,

51
0:02:08,840000 --> 0:02:12,520000
we see Australia, and then the majority of Europe as well.

52
0:02:12,520000 --> 0:02:15,720000
Currently in these countries, a prescription is required

53
0:02:15,720000 --> 0:02:19,400000
for patients to have access to hormonal contraception.

54
0:02:19,400000 --> 0:02:21,480000
On the other hand here, you'll see that there are also

55
0:02:21,480000 --> 0:02:24,320000
a lot of countries that are currently in the light blue,

56
0:02:24,320000 --> 0:02:27,360000
as well as the darker blue, indicating that they actually

57
0:02:27,360000 --> 0:02:30,400000
have over-the-counter sales of hormonal contraceptives

58
0:02:30,400000 --> 0:02:32,080000
that are available in these countries,

59
0:02:32,080000 --> 0:02:35,440000
whether that be through informally or formal institutions

60
0:02:35,440000 --> 0:02:38,120000
and protocols.

61
0:02:38,120000 --> 0:02:39,960000
Narrowing things down into the outlook

62
0:02:39,960000 --> 0:02:42,480000
regarding the United States more specifically,

63
0:02:42,480000 --> 0:02:45,640000
we'll look at our contraceptive use among women here.

64
0:02:45,640000 --> 0:02:47,440000
As you can see here on this diagram

65
0:02:47,440000 --> 0:02:49,880000
that around 65% of women are currently

66
0:02:49,880000 --> 0:02:52,080000
using some sort of contraceptive method

67
0:02:52,080000 --> 0:02:53,800000
within the United States.

68
0:02:53,800000 --> 0:02:57,120000
With the most common form being actually female sterilization

69
0:02:57,120000 --> 0:03:00,200000
at around 18% of women using this form.

70
0:03:00,200000 --> 0:03:02,480000
We also see that oral contraceptive pills

71
0:03:02,480000 --> 0:03:05,720000
are the second commonly most used form

72
0:03:05,720000 --> 0:03:07,320000
of contraceptive in the United States,

73
0:03:07,320000 --> 0:03:09,280000
coming in at around 14%.

74
0:03:09,280000 --> 0:03:12,200000
This will be the primary focus of our presentation.

75
0:03:12,200000 --> 0:03:14,080000
And then we also here, I wanted to point out

76
0:03:14,080000 --> 0:03:16,440000
that there's long-acting reversible contraceptives

77
0:03:16,440000 --> 0:03:18,520000
that are used around 10% of women,

78
0:03:18,520000 --> 0:03:20,520000
and then also the depro-provera,

79
0:03:20,520000 --> 0:03:22,520000
contraceptive rings or patches,

80
0:03:22,520000 --> 0:03:26,280000
are also frequently used in around 3% of women.

81
0:03:26,280000 --> 0:03:27,880000
So to further break down these statistics

82
0:03:27,880000 --> 0:03:28,880000
just a little bit further,

83
0:03:28,880000 --> 0:03:31,320000
and all of this is from the CDC and the NIH

84
0:03:31,320000 --> 0:03:33,520000
if you're interested in looking at it further.

85
0:03:33,520000 --> 0:03:35,280000
But to break it down by race as well,

86
0:03:35,280000 --> 0:03:37
we see when looking at the pills

87
0:03:37 --> 0:03:39,040000
that non-Hispanic white patients

88
0:03:39,040000 --> 0:03:42,680000
are more likely to use oral pill hormonal contraceptive

89
0:03:42,680000 --> 0:03:44,240000
when compared to both Hispanic

90
0:03:44,240000 --> 0:03:46,400000
as well as non-Hispanic black patients.

91
0:03:46,400000 --> 0:03:48,600000
When they come in at are both around 8%,

92
0:03:48,600000 --> 0:03:51,480000
compared to about 18% in white patients.

93
0:03:52,680000 --> 0:03:55,040000
We also see when we break this down by age

94
0:03:55,040000 --> 0:03:57,840000
that there's kind of an inverse relationship with age

95
0:03:57,840000 --> 0:03:59,600000
and then oral contraceptive use.

96
0:03:59,600000 --> 0:04:01,840000
So as patients tend to get older,

97
0:04:01,840000 --> 0:04:05,360000
we see that the rates of patients using oral contraceptive

98
0:04:05,360000 --> 0:04:08,480000
kind of tries, starts to go down.

99
0:04:08,480000 --> 0:04:10,800000
So as you can see here, our patients in the dark blue,

100
0:04:10,800000 --> 0:04:13,440000
so those are our 15 to 19 year old patients,

101
0:04:13,440000 --> 0:04:17,360000
are using oral contraceptive at around 20% of those patients.

102
0:04:17,360000 --> 0:04:20,040000
Moving on to kind of the light blue grayish color here,

103
0:04:20,120000 --> 0:04:23,560000
we see that ages 20 to 29 are our highest users

104
0:04:23,560000 --> 0:04:27,600000
of oral hormonal contraceptives at around 22%.

105
0:04:27,600000 --> 0:04:29,600000
This starts to decrease in our patients

106
0:04:29,600000 --> 0:04:32,760000
who are ages 30 to 39 at around 11%.

107
0:04:32,760000 --> 0:04:35,640000
And then lastly, our patients age 40 to 49

108
0:04:35,640000 --> 0:04:37,680000
come in at around 6 and a half percent.

109
0:04:38,920000 --> 0:04:40,400000
And so I bring all of this up to you

110
0:04:40,400000 --> 0:04:43
because understanding the different variations

111
0:04:43 --> 0:04:45,960000
in contraceptive use across multiple social

112
0:04:45,960000 --> 0:04:48,920000
as well as demographic patterns and characteristics

113
0:04:48,920000 --> 0:04:50,760000
can offer some potential insight

114
0:04:50,760000 --> 0:04:52,920000
into larger fertility patterns,

115
0:04:52,920000 --> 0:04:54,520000
as well as including birth rates

116
0:04:54,520000 --> 0:04:57,400000
and then the incidence of unintended pregnancies

117
0:04:57,400000 --> 0:04:59,080000
here in the United States.

118
0:04:59,080000 --> 0:05:01,080000
So many of you are probably somewhat familiar

119
0:05:01,080000 --> 0:05:04,440000
with the statistic, but around 50% of pregnancies

120
0:05:04,440000 --> 0:05:06,200000
in the US are unintended.

121
0:05:06,200000 --> 0:05:09,040000
That is a rather large number, if you will.

122
0:05:09,040000 --> 0:05:11,880000
About 5% of all unintended pregnancies are in women

123
0:05:11,880000 --> 0:05:14,120000
who are actively using contraceptives

124
0:05:14,120000 --> 0:05:16,160000
both correctly and consistently.

125
0:05:17,080000 --> 0:05:18,640000
That then leads us to the conclusion

126
0:05:18,640000 --> 0:05:21,360000
that the majority of unintended pregnancies

127
0:05:21,360000 --> 0:05:24,560000
are attributed to either contraceptive non-use, right?

128
0:05:24,560000 --> 0:05:25,920000
No, they're not using it at all.

129
0:05:25,920000 --> 0:05:28,320000
Can't expect a benefit or inconsistent use

130
0:05:28,320000 --> 0:05:29,480000
and non-adherence.

131
0:05:30,920000 --> 0:05:32,080000
And so with that being said,

132
0:05:32,080000 --> 0:05:33,840000
now that we understand some of the statistics

133
0:05:33,840000 --> 0:05:35,680000
surrounding the use in our own country

134
0:05:35,680000 --> 0:05:37,400000
as well as some of the other countries,

135
0:05:37,400000 --> 0:05:39,400000
what do you think are some current barriers

136
0:05:39,400000 --> 0:05:42,440000
that could be hindering access to hormonal contraceptives

137
0:05:42,440000 --> 0:05:44,600000
within your own patient populations?

138
0:05:48,640000 --> 0:05:49,480000
There you go.

139
0:05:49,480000 --> 0:05:50,800000
I think you can scan that.

140
0:06:14,080000 --> 0:06:15,680000
Give you a few more seconds here.

141
0:06:15,680000 --> 0:06:16,760000
I see you guys are typing,

142
0:06:16,760000 --> 0:06:18,600000
so I'll let you finish your sentences.

143
0:06:20,800000 --> 0:06:21,720000
Or thoughts.

144
0:06:24,680000 --> 0:06:25,520000
All right.

145
0:06:27,200000 --> 0:06:28,040000
Awesome.

146
0:06:28,040000 --> 0:06:30,360000
So it looks like here we've got a myriad of different answers.

147
0:06:30,360000 --> 0:06:32,120000
So access, absolutely huge.

148
0:06:32,120000 --> 0:06:33,880000
We'll break that down a little bit further.

149
0:06:33,880000 --> 0:06:38,400000
Cost, stigma, social, cultural, religious barriers,

150
0:06:38,400000 --> 0:06:40,080000
low health literacy.

151
0:06:40,080000 --> 0:06:41,760000
The fact that the prescription is required,

152
0:06:41,760000 --> 0:06:44,840000
absolutely, you guys are nailing it right on the head

153
0:06:44,840000 --> 0:06:46,640000
and you might not even need me,

154
0:06:46,640000 --> 0:06:48,160000
but you're exactly right.

155
0:06:48,160000 --> 0:06:49,240000
So good job there.

156
0:06:49,240000 --> 0:06:51,360000
And we'll try to break these down a little bit further

157
0:06:51,360000 --> 0:06:53,520000
as we go throughout the presentation.

158
0:06:53,520000 --> 0:06:56,040000
As of the year 2016, there was a survey

159
0:06:56,040000 --> 0:06:58,520000
that went out to around 1,400 women.

160
0:06:58,520000 --> 0:07:01,040000
Around 68% of these individuals reported

161
0:07:01,040000 --> 0:07:02,440000
that at some point in their life,

162
0:07:02,440000 --> 0:07:05
they tried to get hormonal contraception.

163
0:07:05 --> 0:07:09,440000
Out of the 68% of patients, 29% of them reported problems,

164
0:07:09,440000 --> 0:07:12,080000
either accessing the initial fill of that script

165
0:07:12,080000 --> 0:07:14,200000
or the refills of the script.

166
0:07:14,200000 --> 0:07:15,680000
And it was due to the following reasons.

167
0:07:15,680000 --> 0:07:18,480000
So the first one that was seen in 14% of patients

168
0:07:18,480000 --> 0:07:20,800000
was cost barriers, like many of you alluded to.

169
0:07:20,800000 --> 0:07:23,880000
These can be expensive medications if you're uninsured.

170
0:07:23,880000 --> 0:07:24,960000
Even if you have insurance,

171
0:07:24,960000 --> 0:07:27,120000
sometimes there are copays required.

172
0:07:27,120000 --> 0:07:29,080000
We also know that 13% of the patients

173
0:07:29,080000 --> 0:07:31,560000
reported difficulty obtaining actual appointments,

174
0:07:31,560000 --> 0:07:32,520000
getting to a clinic,

175
0:07:32,520000 --> 0:07:33,880000
where then they could get the prescription.

176
0:07:33,880000 --> 0:07:37,040000
So that could be things like transportation,

177
0:07:37,040000 --> 0:07:38,520000
where they don't have someone to take them.

178
0:07:38,520000 --> 0:07:40,640000
They are using public transportation

179
0:07:40,640000 --> 0:07:41,720000
and they missed a bus.

180
0:07:41,720000 --> 0:07:44,400000
All of those things are falling into this category.

181
0:07:44,400000 --> 0:07:46,800000
We also see 13% of the patients said

182
0:07:46,800000 --> 0:07:49,400000
that the clinic visit itself for the physical exam,

183
0:07:49,400000 --> 0:07:51,280000
as well as the pap smear requirement,

184
0:07:51,280000 --> 0:07:54,280000
deterred them from seeking these medications.

185
0:07:54,280000 --> 0:07:56,720000
And then the last ones here, 10% of patients

186
0:07:56,720000 --> 0:07:58,960000
said that they didn't have a regular physician

187
0:07:58,960000 --> 0:08:01,720000
to go to to even ask for a prescription.

188
0:08:01,720000 --> 0:08:04,360000
And the last 4% said it was because they actually

189
0:08:04,360000 --> 0:08:05,560000
couldn't access the pharmacy.

190
0:08:05,560000 --> 0:08:09,040000
So that now the ball is on our court in regards to that.

191
0:08:10,080000 --> 0:08:11,880000
Breaking things down a little bit further,

192
0:08:11,880000 --> 0:08:14,440000
we see that adherence ultimately comes

193
0:08:14,440000 --> 0:08:17,120000
to be a large barrier for many of our patients.

194
0:08:17,120000 --> 0:08:20,280000
One third of women who start using an oral contraceptive

195
0:08:20,280000 --> 0:08:22,280000
will have stopped using that exact method

196
0:08:22,280000 --> 0:08:25,040000
by the end of the first year of starting it.

197
0:08:25,040000 --> 0:08:25,880000
Why?

198
0:08:25,880000 --> 0:08:27,840000
So there was a study that was put out by ACOG

199
0:08:27,840000 --> 0:08:29,600000
or a statement, if you will.

200
0:08:29,600000 --> 0:08:32,320000
And they attributed this to four major reasons.

201
0:08:32,320000 --> 0:08:34,200000
With the first one being patients struggle

202
0:08:34,200000 --> 0:08:36,680000
with the difficulty of the daily method.

203
0:08:36,680000 --> 0:08:39,080000
So it's hard to remember to take a medication every day.

204
0:08:39,080000 --> 0:08:40,760000
I don't know if you've ever tried to do it.

205
0:08:40,760000 --> 0:08:41,360000
I have.

206
0:08:41,360000 --> 0:08:42,240000
It can be difficult.

207
0:08:42,240000 --> 0:08:43,440000
You can forget.

208
0:08:43,440000 --> 0:08:45,360000
You can get busy with life.

209
0:08:45,360000 --> 0:08:46,680000
And things come up.

210
0:08:46,680000 --> 0:08:49,920000
The other one that they identified was adverse effects.

211
0:08:49,920000 --> 0:08:52,320000
Some of these medications can cause things like acne,

212
0:08:52,320000 --> 0:08:55,560000
potentially a decrease in mood, potentially increased

213
0:08:55,560000 --> 0:08:56,280000
weight gain.

214
0:08:56,280000 --> 0:08:59,360000
Things that a lot of individuals might not necessarily

215
0:08:59,360000 --> 0:09:02,600000
consider to be increasing their quality of life.

216
0:09:02,600000 --> 0:09:04,480000
And then lastly, we talked about costs

217
0:09:04,480000 --> 0:09:06
that plays a large impact.

218
0:09:06 --> 0:09:08,160000
And it does impact a lot of our patients.

219
0:09:08,160000 --> 0:09:10,720000
And then lastly, the lack of time for a medical visit

220
0:09:10,720000 --> 0:09:12,040000
to obtain a prescription.

221
0:09:12,040000 --> 0:09:14,080000
Some of the patients in these surveys

222
0:09:14,080000 --> 0:09:16,240000
were struggling with getting PTO or sick time

223
0:09:16,240000 --> 0:09:18,840000
from their employers and were a fear of getting fired.

224
0:09:18,840000 --> 0:09:22,320000
So things that people are trying to balance behind the scenes

225
0:09:22,320000 --> 0:09:25
that we might not always be aware of upfront when

226
0:09:25 --> 0:09:26,240000
we're dealing with patients.

227
0:09:30,640000 --> 0:09:32,520000
So moving on to an additional barrier

228
0:09:32,520000 --> 0:09:35,360000
and kind of unburying the cost or the financial aspects that

229
0:09:35,360000 --> 0:09:37,200000
can occur for some of our patients.

230
0:09:37,200000 --> 0:09:40,040000
On this diagram here is from the 2022,

231
0:09:40,040000 --> 0:09:43,280000
it was a survey done that was a national survey done

232
0:09:43,280000 --> 0:09:45,680000
on multiple women throughout the country.

233
0:09:45,680000 --> 0:09:49,800000
So it included over 6,000 patients, ages 18 to 49,

234
0:09:49,800000 --> 0:09:51,800000
all of whom did have private insurance.

235
0:09:51,800000 --> 0:09:53,920000
So these are insured individuals, OK?

236
0:09:53,920000 --> 0:09:57,160000
And they all had to use contraception in the past 12 months.

237
0:09:57,160000 --> 0:09:58,640000
If we look at our diagram here, we

238
0:09:58,640000 --> 0:10:01,800000
can see that 70% did report that their insurance kicked in

239
0:10:01,800000 --> 0:10:03,280000
and covered the entire prescription.

240
0:10:03,280000 --> 0:10:06,720000
So that's fantastic for these 70% of these patients.

241
0:10:06,720000 --> 0:10:08,880000
On the other hand, we see in the lighter blue

242
0:10:08,880000 --> 0:10:10,920000
that there was around 25% of patients

243
0:10:10,920000 --> 0:10:13,760000
who stated that either the insurance only covered some of it

244
0:10:13,760000 --> 0:10:15,920000
and then they had to fork out the rest of the cost

245
0:10:15,920000 --> 0:10:18,440000
or that the insurance didn't cover it at all

246
0:10:18,440000 --> 0:10:23,680000
and that it was fully on the patient to carry that burden.

247
0:10:23,680000 --> 0:10:25,640000
We also know that this is going to disproportionately

248
0:10:25,640000 --> 0:10:27,480000
affect patients who are uninsured, right?

249
0:10:27,480000 --> 0:10:28,800000
So the last one that we looked at were

250
0:10:28,800000 --> 0:10:30,400000
patients who have insurance.

251
0:10:30,400000 --> 0:10:32,960000
But one out of five uninsured females

252
0:10:32,960000 --> 0:10:35,480000
have actually stopped their contraceptive due to cost.

253
0:10:35,480000 --> 0:10:36,840000
They can't afford it, right?

254
0:10:36,840000 --> 0:10:38,320000
So this is also disproportionately

255
0:10:38,320000 --> 0:10:40,760000
affecting patients specifically in this study

256
0:10:40,760000 --> 0:10:43,160000
that we looked at patients who were female,

257
0:10:43,160000 --> 0:10:45,280000
or, excuse me, Hispanic females, and then those

258
0:10:45,280000 --> 0:10:48,440000
who are making less than 200% of the federal poverty level.

259
0:10:52,200000 --> 0:10:54,160000
When diving into some of the other barriers,

260
0:10:54,160000 --> 0:10:55,960000
we also see that the racial ethnic,

261
0:10:55,960000 --> 0:10:58,520000
as well as some of those cultural norms and stigmas,

262
0:10:58,520000 --> 0:11:01,280000
like many of you mentioned, when we did our polling question,

263
0:11:01,280000 --> 0:11:02,720000
can come to play as well.

264
0:11:02,720000 --> 0:11:03,680000
This was a study.

265
0:11:03,680000 --> 0:11:05,320000
This was actually done in 2023.

266
0:11:05,320000 --> 0:11:07,920000
So earlier this year, there was a survey sent out

267
0:11:07,920000 --> 0:11:10,160000
to patients who were either black, indigenous,

268
0:11:10,160000 --> 0:11:12,320000
or people of color in the United States.

269
0:11:12,320000 --> 0:11:15,280000
We ultimately got the 727 respondents

270
0:11:15,280000 --> 0:11:18,520000
and almost half of them reported at least one challenge

271
0:11:18,520000 --> 0:11:20,840000
accessing contraception, okay?

272
0:11:20,840000 --> 0:11:23,840000
37% reported this as a logistical challenge.

273
0:11:23,840000 --> 0:11:26
So going back to some of the transportation issues

274
0:11:26 --> 0:11:28,640000
that we discussed earlier, difficulties getting to

275
0:11:28,640000 --> 0:11:29,840000
and from appointments.

276
0:11:29,840000 --> 0:11:33,120000
And then 20% reported some sort of interpersonal challenge.

277
0:11:33,120000 --> 0:11:36,520000
So whether that be with the spouse or parents,

278
0:11:36,520000 --> 0:11:40,040000
or having these conversations with people can be difficult.

279
0:11:40,040000 --> 0:11:43,720000
And ultimately, 20% of them said that that prevented them

280
0:11:43,720000 --> 0:11:46,480000
from getting access to these medications.

281
0:11:46,480000 --> 0:11:48,600000
Within the same group of patients,

282
0:11:48,600000 --> 0:11:51,320000
we also see that this study asked them,

283
0:11:51,320000 --> 0:11:54,120000
if you could get these medications over the counter,

284
0:11:54,120000 --> 0:11:55,240000
would you?

285
0:11:55,240000 --> 0:11:58,800000
67% said, yeah, if we were likely to use

286
0:11:58,800000 --> 0:12:00,560000
and over the counter, prescription,

287
0:12:00,560000 --> 0:12:02,040000
or over the counter medication,

288
0:12:02,040000 --> 0:12:04,840000
oral contraceptive pill, if it was available.

289
0:12:04,840000 --> 0:12:07,840000
We also know that 57% of patients who said

290
0:12:07,840000 --> 0:12:10,480000
that they had not used a contraceptive method

291
0:12:10,480000 --> 0:12:12,680000
in the past year would use it

292
0:12:12,680000 --> 0:12:14,560000
if it was available over the counter.

293
0:12:14,560000 --> 0:12:15,920000
So things to consider.

294
0:12:16,960000 --> 0:12:18,640000
And to summarize what we talked about,

295
0:12:18,640000 --> 0:12:21,800000
and this is certainly not an inclusive list

296
0:12:21,800000 --> 0:12:24,280000
in terms of the barriers that all of our patients face.

297
0:12:24,280000 --> 0:12:26,800000
There's many more that I could take these two hours

298
0:12:26,800000 --> 0:12:29,680000
to go through and dissect all of these barriers

299
0:12:29,680000 --> 0:12:32,360000
with multiple studies and multiple things to back them up.

300
0:12:32,360000 --> 0:12:34,400000
But to briefly summarize things that our patients

301
0:12:34,400000 --> 0:12:37,200000
are likely experiencing are the financial, right,

302
0:12:37,200000 --> 0:12:38,040000
the cost.

303
0:12:38,040000 --> 0:12:40,160000
It can be difficult to afford medications,

304
0:12:40,160000 --> 0:12:45,160000
and hormonal contraception is absolutely included in that.

305
0:12:45,640000 --> 0:12:47,360000
We also know access can be difficult.

306
0:12:47,360000 --> 0:12:50,400000
Getting transportation to and from visits,

307
0:12:50,400000 --> 0:12:51,720000
to and from appointments.

308
0:12:51,720000 --> 0:12:55,840000
We also have the ratio as well as the stigma

309
0:12:55,840000 --> 0:12:58,240000
and the cultural barriers that can be preventing our patients

310
0:12:58,480000 --> 0:13:00,560000
from seeking help in and of itself,

311
0:13:00,560000 --> 0:13:03
let alone taking a hormonal contraceptive.

312
0:13:03 --> 0:13:05,200000
And then the last one, adherence.

313
0:13:05,200000 --> 0:13:06,480000
As you all know, your pharmacists,

314
0:13:06,480000 --> 0:13:08,800000
medications don't work so well if we don't take them.

315
0:13:08,800000 --> 0:13:12
So that can also be a major barrier for our patients

316
0:13:12 --> 0:13:14,120000
in order to receive contraceptive care.

317
0:13:15,680000 --> 0:13:17,320000
And I wanted to pose you with one more thought

318
0:13:17,320000 --> 0:13:18,840000
or one more question.

319
0:13:18,840000 --> 0:13:22,200000
And as a pharmacist, I think that there is a degree

320
0:13:22,200000 --> 0:13:24,240000
of hesitation occasionally with us

321
0:13:24,240000 --> 0:13:26,400000
when we come across new territory

322
0:13:26,400000 --> 0:13:28,600000
that we might not be super familiar with.

323
0:13:28,600000 --> 0:13:32,560000
When looking at a study, it was done early in the 2020s

324
0:13:32,560000 --> 0:13:36,400000
and 2022 and it looked at around 3,000 pharmacists.

325
0:13:36,400000 --> 0:13:38,480000
When they were asked, are you interested

326
0:13:38,480000 --> 0:13:40,600000
in prescribing hormonal contraceptive?

327
0:13:40,600000 --> 0:13:43,560000
85% of them said, yeah, I'm interested.

328
0:13:43,560000 --> 0:13:45,040000
That sounds like it could be a good thing.

329
0:13:45,040000 --> 0:13:47,440000
That could be a good thing for my patients.

330
0:13:47,440000 --> 0:13:49,840000
But they presented a myriad of concerns, right?

331
0:13:49,840000 --> 0:13:50,800000
We're very good at doing that.

332
0:13:50,800000 --> 0:13:52,840000
We're critical, we're analytical.

333
0:13:52,840000 --> 0:13:53,960000
And those are all great things

334
0:13:53,960000 --> 0:13:55,720000
and allow us to be successful.

335
0:13:55,720000 --> 0:13:57,640000
But these pharmacists had three major concerns,

336
0:13:57,640000 --> 0:14:00,200000
with the first one being safety concern, okay?

337
0:14:00,200000 --> 0:14:01,840000
The second one being knowledge gaps.

338
0:14:01,840000 --> 0:14:03,960000
So feeling as though I'm not equipped

339
0:14:03,960000 --> 0:14:06,240000
to prescribe these agents for people.

340
0:14:06,240000 --> 0:14:09,040000
And then also, they also talked about

341
0:14:09,040000 --> 0:14:10,720000
the need for additional training, right?

342
0:14:10,720000 --> 0:14:14
So all valid concerns that definitely apply to pharmacists,

343
0:14:14 --> 0:14:16,640000
both in community, ambulatory care settings.

344
0:14:16,640000 --> 0:14:20,520000
But I would challenge you to look forward to opportunity

345
0:14:20,520000 --> 0:14:22,520000
because if we aren't taking hold of opportunities

346
0:14:22,520000 --> 0:14:24,360000
such as these within legislation

347
0:14:24,360000 --> 0:14:26,800000
within laws that could be passed,

348
0:14:26,800000 --> 0:14:30,480000
nurse practitioners and physician's assistance are, okay?

349
0:14:30,480000 --> 0:14:33,720000
So this is something that we need to try to take hold of.

350
0:14:33,720000 --> 0:14:36,320000
And with that, I will step off my soapbox.

351
0:14:36,320000 --> 0:14:38,720000
But thank you for listening.

352
0:14:38,720000 --> 0:14:42,480000
And that will transition us into our next section here,

353
0:14:42,480000 --> 0:14:45,320000
which involves advocacy and pharmacists prescribing

354
0:14:45,320000 --> 0:14:46,720000
of hormonal contraception.

355
0:14:48,160000 --> 0:14:50,480000
So to start, under the Affordable Care Act here

356
0:14:50,480000 --> 0:14:52,560000
in the United States, all women covered

357
0:14:52,560000 --> 0:14:56,120000
under Medicaid, marketplace and employer-based plans

358
0:14:56,120000 --> 0:14:58,480000
do have access to at least one contraceptive

359
0:14:58,480000 --> 0:15:00,480000
for each FDA-approved method

360
0:15:00,480000 --> 0:15:02,960000
at a $0 copay and deductible.

361
0:15:02,960000 --> 0:15:05,680000
However, as of 2020, the Supreme Court did allow

362
0:15:05,680000 --> 0:15:07,760000
for more employers as well as universities

363
0:15:07,760000 --> 0:15:11,320000
to opt out of covering different hormonal contraceptives

364
0:15:11,320000 --> 0:15:14,680000
due to religious as well as moral objections as well.

365
0:15:15,960000 --> 0:15:18,200000
So in effort to combat some of these barriers

366
0:15:18,200000 --> 0:15:21,440000
to care, pharmacists, specifically community pharmacists

367
0:15:21,440000 --> 0:15:24,320000
and pharmacies, can pose as an extremely accessible

368
0:15:24,320000 --> 0:15:25,760000
resource for patients.

369
0:15:25,760000 --> 0:15:29,320000
We know that the locations around 90% of Americans

370
0:15:29,320000 --> 0:15:31,040000
live within five miles of a pharmacy.

371
0:15:31,040000 --> 0:15:32,560000
They're extremely accessible.

372
0:15:32,560000 --> 0:15:34,160000
We know that the hours are beneficial

373
0:15:34,160000 --> 0:15:37,200000
and that a normal ambulatory clinic might only be open

374
0:15:37,200000 --> 0:15:40,280000
from say eight to four, a nine to five.

375
0:15:40,280000 --> 0:15:42,880000
Whereas a pharmacy, typically we can get the nine

376
0:15:42,880000 --> 0:15:45,720000
to nine hours, potentially 24-hour access.

377
0:15:47,280000 --> 0:15:49,360000
We also know that ACOG does support this.

378
0:15:49,400000 --> 0:15:53,240000
So ACOG also supports over-the-counter sales

379
0:15:53,240000 --> 0:15:56,280000
of hormonal contraception, but they also have a statement

380
0:15:56,280000 --> 0:15:59,360000
out supporting pharmacists provided contraception

381
0:15:59,360000 --> 0:16:02,200000
as what they consider to be an intermediary step

382
0:16:02,200000 --> 0:16:05,960000
to over-the-counter availability of hormonal contraception.

383
0:16:05,960000 --> 0:16:07,080000
So that's good.

384
0:16:07,080000 --> 0:16:08,680000
You should take it and run with it.

385
0:16:08,680000 --> 0:16:10,080000
In terms of pharmacist interest,

386
0:16:10,080000 --> 0:16:11,720000
I alluded to this a little bit before,

387
0:16:11,720000 --> 0:16:14,160000
but we have around 3,000, this is a survey done

388
0:16:14,160000 --> 0:16:17,560000
on almost 3,000 pharmacists who, 85% of them,

389
0:16:17,600000 --> 0:16:19,280000
showed interest in this in providing

390
0:16:19,280000 --> 0:16:22,120000
the hormonal contraceptive services.

391
0:16:22,120000 --> 0:16:24,040000
And not only were pharmacists pretty excited about it,

392
0:16:24,040000 --> 0:16:26,680000
but the patients were very excited about it as well.

393
0:16:26,680000 --> 0:16:30,680000
So 76% of patients in this survey stated

394
0:16:30,680000 --> 0:16:32,960000
that they would benefit from not paying

395
0:16:32,960000 --> 0:16:35,960000
for a clinician visit by having access through a pharmacy.

396
0:16:35,960000 --> 0:16:38,240000
They also said that 58% of patients stated

397
0:16:38,240000 --> 0:16:41,520000
this would be, quote, a big personal advantage.

398
0:16:41,520000 --> 0:16:45,360000
85% said that pharmacists provide both convenient hours

399
0:16:45,360000 --> 0:16:48,920000
as well as convenient locations for them.

400
0:16:48,920000 --> 0:16:52,760000
82% said that pharmacists would help save them time.

401
0:16:52,760000 --> 0:16:56,240000
72% said that pharmacists' access would decrease

402
0:16:56,240000 --> 0:16:58,800000
the number of unintended pregnancies,

403
0:16:58,800000 --> 0:17:03
which if you remember, 50% of unintended pregnancies

404
0:17:03 --> 0:17:06,600000
in the United States are unintended.

405
0:17:08,720000 --> 0:17:11,360000
And with that, we come to our next polling question.

406
0:17:11,360000 --> 0:17:12,680000
Do we have anyone in the room

407
0:17:12,680000 --> 0:17:15
who is currently actively prescribing

408
0:17:15 --> 0:17:16,520000
hormonal contraceptives?

409
0:17:32,240000 --> 0:17:33,080000
All right.

410
0:17:34,840000 --> 0:17:36,880000
Awesome, so we do have a decent amount

411
0:17:36,880000 --> 0:17:39,440000
who will actively are prescribing around 30%

412
0:17:39,440000 --> 0:17:41,320000
compared to 70% who are not.

413
0:17:41,360000 --> 0:17:43,320000
So that's awesome, great.

414
0:17:43,320000 --> 0:17:46,120000
And then based on this question is still for all of you.

415
0:17:46,120000 --> 0:17:49,800000
So even if you don't prescribe hormonal contraceptives,

416
0:17:49,800000 --> 0:17:53,240000
do you feel comfortable with your current skill set today?

417
0:17:53,240000 --> 0:17:55,320000
If I ask you to go do this tomorrow,

418
0:17:55,320000 --> 0:17:56,960000
do you feel comfortable in your skill set

419
0:17:56,960000 --> 0:17:59,480000
in prescribing hormonal contraception?

420
0:18:08,760000 --> 0:18:09,760000
Awesome, good job, you guys.

421
0:18:09,800000 --> 0:18:12,240000
75% and it's okay, the nose, that's okay,

422
0:18:12,240000 --> 0:18:13,560000
that's the point of this presentation,

423
0:18:13,560000 --> 0:18:15,200000
we're gonna dive into this a little bit more,

424
0:18:15,200000 --> 0:18:17,440000
but it seems like the majority of us

425
0:18:17,440000 --> 0:18:19,480000
feel relatively comfortable with it,

426
0:18:19,480000 --> 0:18:22,800000
but likely could still probably use some refreshers as well.

427
0:18:22,800000 --> 0:18:23,880000
And going from that,

428
0:18:23,880000 --> 0:18:25,880000
I wanted to show you currently how many states

429
0:18:25,880000 --> 0:18:27,880000
are allowing for the prescribing

430
0:18:27,880000 --> 0:18:31,160000
of hormonal contraception through pharmacists.

431
0:18:31,160000 --> 0:18:33,600000
At to date, we have around 29 states

432
0:18:33,600000 --> 0:18:34,800000
who are currently allowing this

433
0:18:34,800000 --> 0:18:37,720000
within different regulations and different laws.

434
0:18:37,720000 --> 0:18:40,880000
So I would ask it this time that you refer to this diagram

435
0:18:40,880000 --> 0:18:42,440000
that we have here and find your state

436
0:18:42,440000 --> 0:18:45,040000
and then find what it correlates to in terms of the key,

437
0:18:45,040000 --> 0:18:48,740000
what color you are and see kind of what is available

438
0:18:48,740000 --> 0:18:49,800000
within your state.

439
0:18:51,320000 --> 0:18:53,680000
I will say as well as a little bit of a disclaimer,

440
0:18:53,680000 --> 0:18:55,440000
this is an ever-changing list.

441
0:18:55,440000 --> 0:18:58,280000
As you know, laws get passed, they don't get passed

442
0:18:58,280000 --> 0:18:59,280000
and that sort of a thing.

443
0:18:59,280000 --> 0:19:02,920000
So please do not take this as 100% correct

444
0:19:02,920000 --> 0:19:06,040000
while we did do our diligence of making sure

445
0:19:06,040000 --> 0:19:08,200000
that it was as accurate as we could make it

446
0:19:08,200000 --> 0:19:10,080000
for the sake of this presentation.

447
0:19:10,080000 --> 0:19:13,360000
And while you are finding your states,

448
0:19:13,360000 --> 0:19:14,680000
I'll talk a little bit about mine.

449
0:19:14,680000 --> 0:19:16,760000
So I am from the state of Ohio.

450
0:19:16,760000 --> 0:19:18,440000
As you can see, it's in a little bit

451
0:19:18,440000 --> 0:19:20,240000
of the light blue section there,

452
0:19:20,240000 --> 0:19:22,440000
which states that we have widely used

453
0:19:22,440000 --> 0:19:24,200000
consult practice agreements.

454
0:19:24,200000 --> 0:19:26,600000
And while that's true within the law,

455
0:19:26,600000 --> 0:19:31,600000
I would argue that there are not many pharmacists and pharmacies

456
0:19:32,160000 --> 0:19:34,080000
actively practicing within that

457
0:19:34,080000 --> 0:19:38,120000
or having implemented the law that is allowing us to do so.

458
0:19:38,120000 --> 0:19:39,880000
With that being said, on the contrary,

459
0:19:39,880000 --> 0:19:42,320000
our friendly neighbor up north, Michigan,

460
0:19:42,320000 --> 0:19:45,320000
also in the light blue, has implemented this

461
0:19:45,320000 --> 0:19:49,480000
in a numerous amount of pharmacies and pharmacists.

462
0:19:49,480000 --> 0:19:51,600000
Over 500 pharmacies are currently doing this

463
0:19:51,600000 --> 0:19:52,880000
in the state of Michigan.

464
0:19:52,880000 --> 0:19:56,680000
So there are varying levels of implementation

465
0:19:56,680000 --> 0:19:59,240000
between states even of the same color.

466
0:19:59,240000 --> 0:20:01,240000
So just wanted to point that out for you.

467
0:20:01,960000 --> 0:20:03,880000
All right.

468
0:20:03,880000 --> 0:20:06,200000
And now, how many of you live in a state

469
0:20:06,200000 --> 0:20:08,480000
where pharmacists can prescribe hormonal contraception

470
0:20:08,480000 --> 0:20:10,080000
after looking at that chart?

471
0:20:22,720000 --> 0:20:24,960000
So the vast majority of us do, 85%.

472
0:20:24,960000 --> 0:20:28,320000
It looks like majority of us can do have legislation

473
0:20:28,840000 --> 0:20:32,200000
in play allowing us to prescribe hormonal contraception.

474
0:20:33,480000 --> 0:20:36,200000
And with that, I will pass things off to Dr. King

475
0:20:36,200000 --> 0:20:38,080000
to finish this rest of the presentation.

476
0:20:38,080000 --> 0:20:38,920000
Thank you.

477
0:20:38,920000 --> 0:20:39,760000
Thank you.

478
0:20:39,760000 --> 0:20:40,600000
Thank you.

479
0:20:40,600000 --> 0:20:41,440000
Thank you.

480
0:20:44,440000 --> 0:20:46,040000
Thank you, Dr. Clinton.

481
0:20:46,040000 --> 0:20:50,280000
So as you guys just saw on the graphic of the United States,

482
0:20:50,280000 --> 0:20:55,280000
the vast majority of the states have passed legislature,

483
0:20:55,440000 --> 0:20:57,320000
specifically allowing pharmacists

484
0:20:57,320000 --> 0:20:59,840000
to prescribe hormonal contraceptives,

485
0:20:59,840000 --> 0:21:02,480000
either under statewide standing orders

486
0:21:02,480000 --> 0:21:04,440000
or statewide protocols,

487
0:21:04,440000 --> 0:21:06,400000
with the third most common method

488
0:21:06,400000 --> 0:21:09,680000
being through collaborative practice agreements or CPAs.

489
0:21:09,680000 --> 0:21:11,400000
So we're gonna spend just a few minutes

490
0:21:11,400000 --> 0:21:13,320000
kind of delineating the differences

491
0:21:13,320000 --> 0:21:15,240000
between these three methods.

492
0:21:15,240000 --> 0:21:16,520000
What are some of the benefits?

493
0:21:16,520000 --> 0:21:18,560000
What are some of the challenges

494
0:21:18,560000 --> 0:21:22,080000
before we kind of proceed to the next steps?

495
0:21:22,080000 --> 0:21:23,760000
So collaborative practice agreements

496
0:21:23,840000 --> 0:21:26,120000
are available in all 50 states.

497
0:21:26,120000 --> 0:21:27,960000
That was a pretty recent change.

498
0:21:27,960000 --> 0:21:29,800000
So that's really amazing

499
0:21:29,800000 --> 0:21:32,200000
that this resource is available.

500
0:21:32,200000 --> 0:21:35,520000
But this is a voluntary agreement between a pharmacist

501
0:21:35,520000 --> 0:21:37,840000
and another provider such as a physician,

502
0:21:37,840000 --> 0:21:40,480000
nurse practitioner, physician assistant,

503
0:21:40,480000 --> 0:21:42,640000
depending upon your state laws.

504
0:21:42,640000 --> 0:21:45,320000
And the CPA laws within each state are different.

505
0:21:45,320000 --> 0:21:50,320000
So some dictate which disease states or medications,

506
0:21:50,360000 --> 0:21:54,120000
or if you can start or stop or just adjust,

507
0:21:54,120000 --> 0:21:58,560000
as well as what labs or tests you're able to order.

508
0:21:58,560000 --> 0:22:02,160000
One of the biggest challenges in many states within a CPA

509
0:22:02,160000 --> 0:22:06,160000
is this is often challenging for pharmacists to enter into

510
0:22:06,160000 --> 0:22:08,720000
if they are not directly working

511
0:22:08,720000 --> 0:22:12,040000
with a physician office or health system.

512
0:22:12,040000 --> 0:22:14,840000
So especially for our community pharmacy folks,

513
0:22:14,840000 --> 0:22:17,600000
this can be a real detriment.

514
0:22:17,600000 --> 0:22:20,320000
Statewide standing orders on the other hand

515
0:22:20,320000 --> 0:22:23,880000
are available to all pharmacists within the state.

516
0:22:23,880000 --> 0:22:26,840000
And the prescribing comes down from the state level

517
0:22:26,840000 --> 0:22:28,680000
through a lead physician either through

518
0:22:28,680000 --> 0:22:32,440000
the public department of health or other state agency.

519
0:22:32,440000 --> 0:22:35,320000
And that physician is the authorizing provider

520
0:22:35,320000 --> 0:22:40,320000
on the prescriptions that are being written by the pharmacist.

521
0:22:40,600000 --> 0:22:43,040000
So it's great that it's available to more pharmacists

522
0:22:43,040000 --> 0:22:44,360000
to be able to utilize.

523
0:22:44,360000 --> 0:22:47,440000
But one of the challenges that we can run into

524
0:22:47,440000 --> 0:22:52,160000
is if that lead physician leaves or vacates that position,

525
0:22:52,160000 --> 0:22:56,200000
the new physician coming in may or may not decide

526
0:22:56,200000 --> 0:22:59,720000
to continue to uphold that standing order.

527
0:22:59,720000 --> 0:23:02,440000
So it could create a very immediate halt

528
0:23:02,440000 --> 0:23:05,120000
in the care that we're providing for our patients

529
0:23:05,120000 --> 0:23:07,280000
through these standing orders.

530
0:23:07,280000 --> 0:23:09,680000
Lastly, through our statewide protocols,

531
0:23:09,680000 --> 0:23:12,680000
again, this is coming from the state level.

532
0:23:12,680000 --> 0:23:15,040000
And this is the only one that truly allows

533
0:23:15,040000 --> 0:23:16,800000
for autonomous prescribing.

534
0:23:16,800000 --> 0:23:21
So as a pharmacist, your name would be on the prescription.

535
0:23:21 --> 0:23:23,680000
And the prescribing authority comes

536
0:23:23,680000 --> 0:23:25,480000
through the state board of pharmacy.

537
0:23:25,480000 --> 0:23:28,400000
So we don't have to worry about people coming in

538
0:23:28,400000 --> 0:23:31,640000
and out of political positions or appointments

539
0:23:31,640000 --> 0:23:33,200000
or things like that.

540
0:23:33,200000 --> 0:23:35,280000
Also because it's coming from the state level,

541
0:23:35,280000 --> 0:23:37,960000
it is available to all pharmacists.

542
0:23:38,880000 --> 0:23:43,880000
So with this in mind, if I can get it to click, that'd be great.

543
0:23:44,240000 --> 0:23:45,080000
Oh, there we go.

544
0:23:45,240000 --> 0:23:48,400000
So with this in mind, I want you to take a minute

545
0:23:48,400000 --> 0:23:52,320000
with the folks around you before you start entering in and discuss.

546
0:23:52,320000 --> 0:23:56,160000
What do you think you would advocate for if you were starting

547
0:23:56,160000 --> 0:23:59,480000
from, you know, square one for advocating for pharmacists

548
0:23:59,480000 --> 0:24:02,960000
for scribing of hormonal contraceptives in your state

549
0:24:02,960000 --> 0:24:04,280000
between these three choices?

550
0:24:04,280000 --> 0:24:06,920000
And then also think about the why.

551
0:24:06,920000 --> 0:24:09,360000
So spend a minute or so chatting with each other.

552
0:24:09,360000 --> 0:24:10,880000
And then once you feel like you're a good spot,

553
0:24:10,880000 --> 0:24:12,680000
go ahead and enter in your response.

554
0:24:45,080000 --> 0:24:45,920000
Ah.

555
0:25:04,680000 --> 0:25:07,080000
I'm hearing some really great discussion.

556
0:25:07,080000 --> 0:25:09,880000
Take another second or two to kind of wrap that up

557
0:25:09,880000 --> 0:25:12,560000
and then go ahead and enter in your response.

558
0:25:15,920000 --> 0:25:16,760000
Okay.

559
0:25:32,360000 --> 0:25:33,200000
All righty.

560
0:25:33,200000 --> 0:25:37,880000
So it looks like most of you would argue for the statewide protocol

561
0:25:37,880000 --> 0:25:42,200000
and then the CPA's and standing orders are a little bit more equivalent.

562
0:25:42,200000 --> 0:25:45,240000
And so I was just curious why you guys chose that.

563
0:25:45,240000 --> 0:25:47,640000
So if you can type in a couple words to kind of let me know

564
0:25:47,640000 --> 0:25:50,720000
what your thoughts were as to why you ended up on that decision,

565
0:25:50,720000 --> 0:25:51,960000
whichever one it was.

566
0:26:12,920000 --> 0:26:14,080000
All righty.

567
0:26:14,080000 --> 0:26:17,200000
So some folks are saying coordinated in the state.

568
0:26:17,200000 --> 0:26:19,400000
And so we can do it without a CPA.

569
0:26:19,400000 --> 0:26:21,400000
Increased access seems to be common.

570
0:26:21,400000 --> 0:26:26,800000
The autonomy, the protocol allows for more pharmacists autonomy,

571
0:26:26,800000 --> 0:26:29,800000
ability for immediate implementation,

572
0:26:29,800000 --> 0:26:32,200000
stability with the conditions or rules.

573
0:26:32,200000 --> 0:26:36,800000
Rule access gives pharmacists and all settings access to prescribe.

574
0:26:36,800000 --> 0:26:37,400000
Absolutely.

575
0:26:37,400000 --> 0:26:38,800000
These are all the same.

576
0:26:38,800000 --> 0:26:40,800000
So thank you so much for sharing.

577
0:26:40,800000 --> 0:26:44,800000
So now that we understand where our prescriptive authority comes from,

578
0:26:44,800000 --> 0:26:50,800000
I wanted to briefly summarize what is currently out there in the states who are doing this.

579
0:26:50,800000 --> 0:26:54,800000
So the majority of the states have focused on pharmacists prescribing

580
0:26:54,800000 --> 0:26:57,800000
of hormonal contraceptives that are self-administered.

581
0:26:57,800000 --> 0:26:59,800000
So we have a lot of people who are doing this.

582
0:26:59,800000 --> 0:27:02,800000
And so I think that's a lot of people who are doing this.

583
0:27:02,800000 --> 0:27:05,800000
And so I think that's a lot of people who are doing this.

584
0:27:05,800000 --> 0:27:32,100000
So because you say one thing with the

585
0:27:32,100000 --> 0:27:35,120000
Meaning of hormonal contraceptives that are self-administered.

586
0:27:35,120000 --> 0:27:41,760000
of. With a smaller proportion, maybe closer to 50%, also including the injection or shot

587
0:27:41,760000 --> 0:27:48,880000
with the depo-medro. Depro-pervera, sorry.

588
0:27:48,880000 --> 0:27:53,600000
Some of the literature regarding the success and challenges of pharmacists prescribing

589
0:27:53,600000 --> 0:27:57,760000
hormonal contraceptive, we're going to start with a couple of states focused on statewide

590
0:27:57,760000 --> 0:28:03,760000
protocols and then move into some of the other methods. Oregon was the first state to implement

591
0:28:03,760000 --> 0:28:09,520000
pharmacists prescribing a hormonal contraceptive through the statewide protocol in 2016. So actually

592
0:28:09,520000 --> 0:28:16,880000
not that long ago and they did several studies very quickly after implementation to share the

593
0:28:16,880000 --> 0:28:24,800000
results of what they had learned. And so within the first year of implementation, they found that 63

594
0:28:24,800000 --> 0:28:29,600000
percent of the zip codes in the state had at least one pharmacist certified to prescribe

595
0:28:29,600000 --> 0:28:34,880000
hormonal contraception, which I personally find absolutely amazing for the first year of

596
0:28:34,880000 --> 0:28:41,520000
implementation. I know Ohio recently passed a statewide protocol for tobacco cessation and

597
0:28:42,880000 --> 0:28:49,920000
we're nowhere close to 63 percent. So that was really awesome to me. And this included 42 percent

598
0:28:49,920000 --> 0:28:57,360000
of pharmacies. As we'll see in the next slide, they also did some claims data to further investigate

599
0:28:57,360000 --> 0:29:03,360000
their footprint within Medicaid and found that out of Medicaid prescriptions written for the

600
0:29:04,160000 --> 0:29:10,080000
contraceptive pills or patches that 10 percent of them were written by pharmacists. Again, in this

601
0:29:10,080000 --> 0:29:17,200000
very early stage, that's very impressive. There was also study looking at rural versus urban

602
0:29:17,200000 --> 0:29:25,280000
utilization comparing Oregon and New Mexico. And what they found is with Oregon's utilization

603
0:29:25,360000 --> 0:29:33,200000
being primarily urban based and New Mexico's being primarily rural based that the proportion

604
0:29:33,200000 --> 0:29:39,600000
prescriptions written by a pharmacist were very similar between the two settings. So I think this

605
0:29:40,400000 --> 0:29:46,480000
further helps to demonstrate that this is not something that is just needed in one specific

606
0:29:46,480000 --> 0:29:52,560000
part of the country or the city versus the county, but really something that is needed

607
0:29:52,560000 --> 0:29:57,520000
everywhere. And I think this further supports the information that Dr. Clunen presented a little

608
0:29:57,520000 --> 0:30:06,640000
bit earlier. Also in this rural versus urban delineation, they found that nearly 50 percent

609
0:30:06,640000 --> 0:30:11,600000
of patients in both of the settings were actually paying for the pharmacist consultative fee.

610
0:30:12,160000 --> 0:30:18,800000
And it wasn't necessarily being covered by the insurance. One of the things that did come out of

611
0:30:18,800000 --> 0:30:25,440000
it was an overall need for additional understanding and knowledge by the pharmacists and pharmacies

612
0:30:25,440000 --> 0:30:32,720000
to know which insurances would cover the consultative fee versus which ones would not. So an area for

613
0:30:32,720000 --> 0:30:41,520000
improvement. After that initial year, Oregon went on to do two additional studies that were two-year

614
0:30:41,520000 --> 0:30:49,840000
studies each, both from 2016 to 2017. The first study focused on pharmacists utilization and the

615
0:30:49,840000 --> 0:30:55,840000
second study focused on the cost effectiveness of pharmacists prescribing hormonal contraceptives.

616
0:30:56,720000 --> 0:31:01,600000
Both of these were focused in the Medicaid patient populations, again because it was very

617
0:31:01,600000 --> 0:31:07,920000
easy to pull the claims data for this. And so what they found specifically within the Medicaid

618
0:31:07,920000 --> 0:31:16,320000
claims data is that for the utilization, most of the claims originated from retail chain

619
0:31:16,320000 --> 0:31:22,960000
pharmacies in urban locations. And most patients were receiving a combined hormonal contraceptive

620
0:31:22,960000 --> 0:31:28,640000
pill. One of the things that I found really interesting and very kind of inspiring for the

621
0:31:28,640000 --> 0:31:35,200000
profession is three out of every four of the patients had no history of contraceptive prescriptions

622
0:31:35,200000 --> 0:31:42,480000
in the previous 30 days. So this really gets back to those preventing unintended pregnancies

623
0:31:42,480000 --> 0:31:49,040000
and some of the challenges that Dr. Klunen had discussed as far as adherence and barriers to

624
0:31:49,040000 --> 0:31:55,520000
transportation and costs and all of those other things that they were really able to reach those

625
0:31:55,520000 --> 0:32:01,520000
individuals and help to ultimately prevent those unintended pregnancies would be the goal.

626
0:32:02,400000 --> 0:32:08,480000
In the cost analysis study, they looked at again the Medicaid claims from the pharmacists and in

627
0:32:08,480000 --> 0:32:14,160000
Oregon the pharmacists were being reimbursed for their consultative fees for any Medicaid patients.

628
0:32:14,880000 --> 0:32:21,840000
And so they estimated that there was a $1.6 million cost savings associated with pharmacists

629
0:32:22,560000 --> 0:32:28,640000
working in this area. One of the assumptions that was made is that during the pharmacist

630
0:32:28,640000 --> 0:32:34,160000
consultation that they were very focused on the patient interview related to the hormonal

631
0:32:34,160000 --> 0:32:40,080000
contraceptives. And so likely the visits were more focused and therefore build at a lower level.

632
0:32:40,640000 --> 0:32:47,120000
They assumed a level two versus clinician appointments likely were addressing many issues in one

633
0:32:47,120000 --> 0:32:52,800000
appointment. And so we're likely being billed at a slightly higher level such as a level three or

634
0:32:52,800000 --> 0:32:59,040000
four where the assumptions made in the study. One of the driving take home points from this

635
0:32:59,040000 --> 0:33:05,200000
article was you know for a maximal benefit it really does require full implementation

636
0:33:06,080000 --> 0:33:10,720000
of the policy. So it's not just enough to have the laws passed. We really need to go forward

637
0:33:10,720000 --> 0:33:16,320000
and implement it which I'll talk about more in a few slides. And one of the driving factors

638
0:33:16,320000 --> 0:33:22
that they at least felt like helped with implementation was the fact that pharmacists were being reimbursed.

639
0:33:22,560000 --> 0:33:29,600000
Around the same time California had also passed a statewide protocol and their implementation

640
0:33:29,600000 --> 0:33:35,760000
was significantly lagging that of organs. However pharmacists were not being reimbursed through

641
0:33:35,760000 --> 0:33:40,800000
Medicaid for the consultation. And so that was thought to be part of that discussion.

642
0:33:42,400000 --> 0:33:50,560000
Now to compare these statewide protocol states to a state that is using a CPA, I pulled a study

643
0:33:50,560000 --> 0:33:56,800000
regarding pharmacists prescribing of hormonal contraceptives in Washington. Again this is based

644
0:33:56,800000 --> 0:34:02,480000
in our community pharmacies. So 18 pharmacies where they surveyed 26 community pharmacists.

645
0:34:03,360000 --> 0:34:08,640000
The objective of this study was to not only look at the impact of pharmacists prescribed

646
0:34:08,640000 --> 0:34:14,160000
contraceptive care on initiation and continuation rates but also to look at the effectiveness of

647
0:34:14,160000 --> 0:34:21,040000
the patient self-screening and the feasibility of pharmacies to be able to do this. And so their

648
0:34:21,040000 --> 0:34:27,440000
intervention was for pharmacists to identify women who were at risk for unintended pregnancies and

649
0:34:27,440000 --> 0:34:33,600000
offer to evaluate them to determine if they could safely use a hormonal contraceptive. And they

650
0:34:33,600000 --> 0:34:40,080000
could specifically prescribe pills, patch or the ring. And there was some exclusion criteria.

651
0:34:40,960000 --> 0:34:47,920000
The results showed that of the patients that were offered the service and screened 90 over

652
0:34:47,920000 --> 0:34:54,880000
90 percent of them received a hormonal contraceptive by the pharmacist. A little bit different from

653
0:34:54,880000 --> 0:35:00,960000
Oregon or maybe it's also how they reported the information 87 percent of the patients had been

654
0:35:00,960000 --> 0:35:06,400000
on a hormonal contraceptive in the past. And the reason why I say it may just be how the data is

655
0:35:06,400000 --> 0:35:11,840000
presented is Oregon specifically looked at if they had had a hormonal contraceptive in the past

656
0:35:11,840000 --> 0:35:17,680000
30 days. So it was a very isolated time period. The continuation rates were evaluated at one

657
0:35:17,680000 --> 0:35:23,520000
month, six months and 12 months. And as you can see over time it does decrease which is what we

658
0:35:23,520000 --> 0:35:30,800000
see with usual care and these stats match the ones that Dr. Koonan had covered earlier. Interestingly

659
0:35:30,880000 --> 0:35:37,600000
80 percent of the patients paid for these services out of pocket and nearly 100 percent of them

660
0:35:37,600000 --> 0:35:43,600000
were satisfied or very satisfied with the pharmacy services and wanted to continue to see the

661
0:35:43,600000 --> 0:35:49,760000
pharmacist. So this is something that they found valuable and wanted to continue to seek these

662
0:35:49,760000 --> 0:35:57,440000
services. So across the United States we're all in a different spot along this continuum.

663
0:35:57,440000 --> 0:36:04,560000
Some of us are still in the you know bills going before the House or the Senate which is more so

664
0:36:04,560000 --> 0:36:13,440000
where Ohio is at. We haven't made it to the next step yet. Others have very recently gotten you

665
0:36:13,440000 --> 0:36:19,680000
know laws passed and are more in the rulemaking and protocols. And then there's a lot who have

666
0:36:19,680000 --> 0:36:24,320000
you know surpassed this and they're working on that training and public awareness. I think one of

667
0:36:24,320000 --> 0:36:29,440000
the big things I want to call out is it doesn't stop after number two. After the rulemaking and

668
0:36:29,440000 --> 0:36:34,800000
protocols like our work has really just kind of begun at that point and really to be successful

669
0:36:34,800000 --> 0:36:41,040000
and to help our patients we need to continue to drive that forward. And so to expand on this a

670
0:36:41,040000 --> 0:36:46,880000
little bit more I really wanted to kind of highlight where we're at across the nation in a little bit

671
0:36:46,880000 --> 0:36:52,880000
of a different perspective than what was shown earlier. So I looked at not only preterm birth

672
0:36:52,880000 --> 0:36:59,200000
rates but also the unintended pregnancy rates. I ultimately decided to put up the graphic of

673
0:36:59,200000 --> 0:37:05,040000
preterm birth rates because it has been more recently updated in 2021 versus the graphic of

674
0:37:05,040000 --> 0:37:13,440000
unintended pregnancies is a decade outdated from 2013. However we do know that 43 percent of

675
0:37:13,440000 --> 0:37:19,920000
pregnancies are unintended and we have a long ways to go to meet our healthy people 2030 target of

676
0:37:20 --> 0:37:27,600000
36.5 percent. However when we look at the states who have specifically implemented

677
0:37:27,600000 --> 0:37:33,520000
pharmacists prescribing of hormonal contraceptives represented by the states with a star we can see

678
0:37:34,160000 --> 0:37:39,280000
some of the states who have been doing this for a long time their preterm birth rates are much lower.

679
0:37:39,920000 --> 0:37:46,880000
But also the the laws are passing in a variety of states regardless of preterm birth rates being

680
0:37:46,880000 --> 0:37:53,360000
high or low. One of the reasons I chose to look at preterm birth rates is often they are correlated

681
0:37:53,360000 --> 0:37:59,360000
with unintended pregnancies because we're having lower rates of prenatal care and so I felt like it

682
0:37:59,360000 --> 0:38:05,920000
was a reasonable comparison. But there are many states who have passed laws very recently.

683
0:38:05,920000 --> 0:38:11,120000
Approximately a third of the states that have passed for pharmacists to be able to prescribe

684
0:38:11,120000 --> 0:38:17,280000
hormonal contraceptives have been in the last three years alone. So we have a large proportion

685
0:38:17,280000 --> 0:38:24,400000
of the country who is really in that implementation phase which is really exciting to me and so I

686
0:38:24,400000 --> 0:38:29,840000
have some a few resources on the next couple of slides depending upon where you are along the

687
0:38:29,840000 --> 0:38:36,240000
continuum. So for those of us who are still advocating for the profession to be able to do this I have

688
0:38:36,240000 --> 0:38:42,400000
some key takeaways for our legislators. One it is safe and effective for pharmacists to be able to

689
0:38:43,040000 --> 0:38:49,120000
prescribe hormonal contraceptives for our patients. It helps to reduce unintended pregnancies. This is

690
0:38:49,120000 --> 0:38:56,480000
a rural equity issue. It's a bipartisan issue and it's supported by the medical community at large

691
0:38:56,480000 --> 0:39:03,920000
as Dr. Clinton discussed with a Cog statement. For those of you who have maybe recently had laws

692
0:39:03,920000 --> 0:39:09,280000
passed or you're still in the implementation phase these are just some really great resources

693
0:39:09,280000 --> 0:39:15,280000
to help with pharmacists training. I do not have an association with any of these but I do find

694
0:39:15,280000 --> 0:39:21,120000
them very helpful. So resources that you can take back home to help on your next steps.

695
0:39:22,640000 --> 0:39:30,640000
And with that we're going to move into our updates on hormonal contraceptives. For the sake of this

696
0:39:30,640000 --> 0:39:37,200000
presentation I'm going to do a very very brief overview of contraceptives in general. But as we

697
0:39:37,200000 --> 0:39:43,520000
move throughout I chose not to focus on things that were applicable to basically all hormonal

698
0:39:43,520000 --> 0:39:48,400000
contraceptives such as all of the contraindications or all of the side effects that fall within a

699
0:39:48,400000 --> 0:39:54,320000
particular group and instead chose to focus in on those things that were very unique to a specific

700
0:39:54,320000 --> 0:40:01,600000
product because I didn't want those to get lost in the jumble. Additionally we're going to be

701
0:40:01,600000 --> 0:40:08,880000
talking about the CDC's medication eligibility criteria or MEC. This is a great resource that

702
0:40:08,880000 --> 0:40:16,240000
really focuses on disease states and conditions and can serve as an excellent resource if you maybe

703
0:40:16,240000 --> 0:40:22,480000
don't recall all of those contraindications or relative contraindications when you're working

704
0:40:22,480000 --> 0:40:29,600000
with patients. And we'll be going over that more in detail. So to get started very basic review of

705
0:40:29,600000 --> 0:40:37,920000
hormones in our contraceptive products estrogen is not a contraceptive but instead helps to stabilize

706
0:40:37,920000 --> 0:40:43,440000
our enematial lining and provide cycle control and this would always be in combination with our

707
0:40:43,440000 --> 0:40:49,840000
progestin which is actually serving as the contraceptive component which helps to thicken the cervical

708
0:40:49,840000 --> 0:40:56,320000
mucus prevent sperm mobility inhibit ovulation most of the time and break down endometrial tissue.

709
0:40:56,960000 --> 0:41:03,840000
We should not be using estrogen by itself. It will not help with contraception and can increase

710
0:41:03,840000 --> 0:41:09,760000
endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. We would only use that when treating menopause

711
0:41:10,400000 --> 0:41:17,040000
with the vasomotor symptoms. When we look specifically at our contraceptive products I divide them into

712
0:41:17,040000 --> 0:41:22,480000
five very large groups and for the sake of today we're going to be focusing on those that have a

713
0:41:22,480000 --> 0:41:29,440000
hormonal component with the exclusion of progestin, IUD and progestin implant as those are not self

714
0:41:29,440000 --> 0:41:37,920000
administered and therefore are not typically included in the statewide standing orders or protocols.

715
0:41:39,520000 --> 0:41:46,160000
As we work with our patients and determining which hormonal contraceptive would be best for them

716
0:41:46,160000 --> 0:41:51,920000
there are five main points that we should kind of work through and these will be items that I cover

717
0:41:51,920000 --> 0:41:56,800000
and then Dr. Anderson will continue and then we'll kind of pull it all together with our case

718
0:41:56,800000 --> 0:42:02,880000
scenarios at the end but we should be considering the hormonal components. The complexity of the

719
0:42:02,880000 --> 0:42:08,720000
regimen is Dr. Klunen discussed adherence is one of the biggest barriers to folks taking their

720
0:42:08,800000 --> 0:42:16,160000
contraceptives, route of administration, the start of therapy as well as comorbid conditions

721
0:42:16,160000 --> 0:42:22,400000
and so we're going to focus on comorbid conditions for a few minutes. As I introduced earlier the

722
0:42:22,400000 --> 0:42:32
CDC has a medication eligibility criteria. The CDC also is our guideline that exists for prescribing

723
0:42:32 --> 0:42:38,800000
of hormonal contraceptives which Dr. Anderson will go into more detail but the MEK has a plethora

724
0:42:38,800000 --> 0:42:45,520000
of disease dates and conditions and then next to those they have a score one through four that

725
0:42:45,520000 --> 0:42:51,520000
determines whether or not we should be using specific contraceptive products. So one meaning

726
0:42:51,520000 --> 0:42:58,800000
that there are no restrictions on using that so like minimal risk lots of benefit for meaning that

727
0:42:59,280000 --> 0:43:05,520000
there are unacceptable health risks with that contraceptive benefit or method so that the

728
0:43:05,520000 --> 0:43:10,880000
risk is so much more than the potential benefit and this is what it would actually look like if

729
0:43:10,880000 --> 0:43:17,680000
you pull it up on your computer. On the far left hand side is the general condition. The column next

730
0:43:17,680000 --> 0:43:24,960000
to it has further descriptors that may help to put your patient into a subgroup and then the right

731
0:43:24,960000 --> 0:43:32,160000
half of the document that's all colorful is actually broken down into the different products.

732
0:43:32,160000 --> 0:43:38,160000
So if you look at the very top in the dark blue in the middle we're going to start. That's our

733
0:43:38,160000 --> 0:43:47,200000
copper IUD. The next group is our levonogestral IUDs and the next is the progestin implant and

734
0:43:47,280000 --> 0:43:56,480000
then we go to our depot injection. Next is our progestin only pill. My one caveat with this is

735
0:43:56,480000 --> 0:44:03,680000
the MEK was last updated in 2016. At that time the only progestin only pill available was

736
0:44:03,680000 --> 0:44:09,920000
Nordestral. I'm going to be talking about a new progestrin only pill. There are differences so I

737
0:44:10 --> 0:44:17,520000
would be very cautious applying that column just globally to all progestrin pills but we'll talk

738
0:44:17,520000 --> 0:44:23,040000
about some of the differences and then lastly is our combined hormonal contraceptives. So most of

739
0:44:23,040000 --> 0:44:30,960000
time as pharmacists we're going to be operating in the FAR 3 columns. Underneath the drug you'll

740
0:44:30,960000 --> 0:44:37,760000
see an eye and a C. The eye is if a patient is being initiated on that product versus a C is that

741
0:44:37,840000 --> 0:44:42,720000
they're being continued. And so you can see as you kind of go down there's some of those boxes

742
0:44:42,720000 --> 0:44:48
that are split and the recommendations vary depending upon whether it's initiation or continuation.

743
0:44:49,040000 --> 0:44:55,440000
So if we take this information and we specifically look at smoking. So if we were you know meeting

744
0:44:55,440000 --> 0:45:00,640000
with the patient the only thing on their screening tool was smoking we would go to that on our MEK

745
0:45:00,640000 --> 0:45:06,800000
and we would see oh there's three subcategories age and how much they're smoking.

746
0:45:07,280000 --> 0:45:14,240000
So if my patient was less than 35 as I go across I see okay everything's ones until I get to that

747
0:45:14,240000 --> 0:45:19,440000
combined hormonal contraceptive and then it's a two three and four depending upon the age and how

748
0:45:19,440000 --> 0:45:25,440000
much you're smoking. So you can very easily see how your patient can fit in there and so if we had

749
0:45:25,440000 --> 0:45:32,400000
an older patient who was smoking we probably would not end up using a combined hormonal

750
0:45:32,480000 --> 0:45:37,360000
contraceptive because of the risks associated with that. So this is how you would use the tool.

751
0:45:38,960000 --> 0:45:44,320000
Other things that we need to consider are failure rates. So these can be due to the

752
0:45:44,320000 --> 0:45:49,440000
medications themselves or products themselves as well as the adherence to them really makes up a

753
0:45:49,440000 --> 0:45:56,960000
big difference. As you look in literature the the failure rate differs in the drug studies

754
0:45:56,960000 --> 0:46:04,080000
compared to usual use as well. So they're divided into three main categories at the top

755
0:46:04,080000 --> 0:46:09,040000
being most effective at the bottom being least effective. Our most effective products are going

756
0:46:09,040000 --> 0:46:15,680000
to be our implant, our IUDs and sterilization resulting in less than one pregnancy per 100

757
0:46:15,680000 --> 0:46:22,080000
patients per year with our least effective being condoms, cervical caps, sponge, fertility awareness

758
0:46:22,080000 --> 0:46:29,040000
and spermicides resulting in 18 plus unintended pregnancies per 100 patients per year.

759
0:46:29,920000 --> 0:46:34,640000
The majority of the products that we would be prescribing as pharmacists are going to fall in

760
0:46:34,640000 --> 0:46:42,960000
the middle category with six to ten unintended pregnancies per year and you know all of them have

761
0:46:42,960000 --> 0:46:49,440000
differing adherence challenges with them that we'll be able to discuss with our patients.

762
0:46:50,320000 --> 0:46:56,240000
In the CDC guidelines they also go on to call out specific high risk conditions

763
0:46:57,040000 --> 0:47:03,440000
for pregnancy. So these are comorbid conditions that if the patient would become pregnant

764
0:47:03,440000 --> 0:47:10,160000
that the patient could experience adverse events because of that pregnancy. And based on these

765
0:47:10,160000 --> 0:47:17,920000
conditions the CDC has recommended that patients be on a long-acting highly effective medication

766
0:47:18,640000 --> 0:47:24,880000
contraceptive and that patient should be counseled that they should not use barrier based or

767
0:47:26,240000 --> 0:47:32,560000
behavioral based contraceptive options because of the higher than typical failure rate.

768
0:47:33,360000 --> 0:47:40,240000
So it is still possible that we could use like pills or patches or rings but you know kind of the

769
0:47:40,240000 --> 0:47:45,200000
highest level of recommendation would be for those long acting highly effectable options such as

770
0:47:45,280000 --> 0:47:52,400000
the implant IUD or sterilization. All righty we have finally made it to the new drug update just a

771
0:47:52,400000 --> 0:48:00,960000
few more slides before Dr. Anderson takes over. So our first medication is suggest-rown acetate

772
0:48:00,960000 --> 0:48:08,480000
ethanol estradiol. This was approved in fall of 2018. It's a ring that's inserted for three weeks

773
0:48:08,480000 --> 0:48:13,920000
and removed for one. Its biggest difference from the other product that's already available is

774
0:48:13,920000 --> 0:48:21,600000
that this ring is reusable and is used up to 13 cycles so approximately one year versus kind

775
0:48:21,600000 --> 0:48:28,320000
of throwing it out after each cycle. The company also created an app to help with adherence.

776
0:48:29,120000 --> 0:48:35,440000
One of the things I wanted to point out was the avoid use in BMI greater than 29. So originally

777
0:48:35,440000 --> 0:48:42,400000
for the study they were enrolling patients who did have a BMI greater than 29 but they found

778
0:48:42,480000 --> 0:48:49,040000
around the 50 percent enrollment mark that there were two episodes of VTE specifically in those

779
0:48:49,040000 --> 0:48:56,400000
patients who had a BMI greater than 29 and at that time they made the decision to cease enrolling

780
0:48:56,400000 --> 0:49:03,840000
any patients who had a BMI of greater than 29 and to disenroll all existing patients who had a BMI

781
0:49:03,840000 --> 0:49:11,360000
of greater than 29. This resulted in 200 plus patients being disenrolled from the study and us

782
0:49:11,360000 --> 0:49:19,520000
only having data on 36 patients. Because of that the lack of information, the potential increase

783
0:49:19,520000 --> 0:49:25,600000
VTE risk it is not recommended to use this product in patients who have a BMI greater than 29.

784
0:49:26,320000 --> 0:49:31,440000
There's also some side effects that are a little bit different with this medication where we can

785
0:49:31,440000 --> 0:49:37,680000
see higher expulsion rates of the ring within the first few weeks, higher rates of migraines and

786
0:49:37,680000 --> 0:49:42,400000
headaches. I would say particularly with any hormonal contraceptive if your patient

787
0:49:43,360000 --> 0:49:48,640000
you know starts having more headaches or migraines after they initiate on it you should likely

788
0:49:48,640000 --> 0:49:54,560000
switch them to something else otherwise their adherence is likely to be poor and then we also

789
0:49:54,560000 --> 0:50:02,640000
see higher rates of nausea and my my acotic yeast infections. Next we have Drosperinone.

790
0:50:02,640000 --> 0:50:10,400000
This is our other progestin only pill. It was approved in May of 2019. This one is different

791
0:50:10,400000 --> 0:50:16,320000
than Nordgestrel so as we kind of move through I'm going to compare and contrast the two progestin

792
0:50:16,320000 --> 0:50:23,520000
only pills for you. So Drosperinone is a fourth generation progestin versus Nordgestrel is a

793
0:50:23,520000 --> 0:50:31,600000
second generation and so with that fourth generation we see that it does help with acne but it does

794
0:50:31,680000 --> 0:50:42,080000
come with an increased risk of BTE. Additionally Nordgestrel only has active pills but Drosperinone

795
0:50:42,080000 --> 0:50:48,400000
has inactive pills that come along with it so you're going to have more of that normal cycle that

796
0:50:48,400000 --> 0:50:56,240000
you would with a combined hormonal contraceptive. The study did include patients with a BMI up to 35

797
0:50:57,040000 --> 0:51:02,160000
and it did include about 35 percent of patients with that BMI between 30 to 35 so we do have

798
0:51:02,160000 --> 0:51:12,080000
some data for those patients. Next this is one that's probably not included in standing orders

799
0:51:12,080000 --> 0:51:18,160000
or state protocols right now but it was a new drug added to our contraceptive tool bag so I didn't

800
0:51:18,160000 --> 0:51:24,400000
want to exclude it. This is lactic acid, sictic acid and potassium by tartrate. This is a sperm

801
0:51:24,400000 --> 0:51:30,640000
aside but it's only available via prescription. It was approved in May of 2020 and you insert

802
0:51:30,640000 --> 0:51:36,640000
five grams vaginally prior to intercourse or up to one hour before. It can be used in combination

803
0:51:36,640000 --> 0:51:43,520000
with other hormonal contraceptives except for the ring and it can also be used in combination with

804
0:51:43,520000 --> 0:51:49,840000
condoms and diaphragms so that can be really beneficial for some of our patients. We would want to avoid

805
0:51:49,840000 --> 0:51:57,040000
use in patients who have UTIs or urinary tract abnormalities and then as we would probably expect

806
0:51:57,040000 --> 0:52:03,280000
from the name, most of the side effects are going to be more of that vovovaginal burning,

807
0:52:03,280000 --> 0:52:10,640000
pyridus, mycotic infections and discomfort but that's not only for our female patients but also

808
0:52:10,640000 --> 0:52:21,120000
their male counterparts. Next we have dresperinone esstral and this was approved in April of 2021.

809
0:52:21,120000 --> 0:52:27,520000
This is a combined hormonal contraceptive pill, 24 active pills for inert because it has the

810
0:52:27,520000 --> 0:52:35,280000
dresperinone component. We see similar things that we would have expected so in addition to what I

811
0:52:35,280000 --> 0:52:41,120000
talked about with the increased VTE risk, dresperinone has anti-mineral corticoid

812
0:52:41,840000 --> 0:52:49,680000
activity and so because of that we see increased rates of hyperkalemia. These rates of hyperkalemia

813
0:52:49,680000 --> 0:52:56,560000
are very similar to what we see with spironolactone 25 milligrams once a day. So to give you something

814
0:52:56,560000 --> 0:53:03,760000
to kind of compare it to, so we would need to be cautious using any products containing dresperinone

815
0:53:03,840000 --> 0:53:09,760000
in patients who are on other medications that can increase the risk of hyperkalemia or those

816
0:53:09,760000 --> 0:53:18,640000
that are at a predisposition for hyperkalemia or have renal impairment. Okay our last prescription

817
0:53:18,640000 --> 0:53:25,440000
new drug is levonodgestral ethanolestradiol. This combination has existed for quite a long time

818
0:53:25,440000 --> 0:53:32,960000
in a pill but it's now available as a transdermal patch as well. Again you see this avoid use in

819
0:53:32,960000 --> 0:53:38,960000
BMI of 30 or above so that same cutoff that we've seen with some of our earlier studies.

820
0:53:39,520000 --> 0:53:46
This one the drugs the manufacturer did enroll patients into their drug studies all the way up

821
0:53:46 --> 0:53:55,520000
to a BMI of 35. They actually had 35% of their patients with a BMI of 30 to 35 but they saw that

822
0:53:55,520000 --> 0:54:01,360000
there was an increased risk of adverse events and decreased efficacy. So in these studies four

823
0:54:01,440000 --> 0:54:08,960000
patients had VTEs and they were all in that BMI group of 30 and above and then we see where the

824
0:54:08,960000 --> 0:54:15,440000
efficacy also decreases as the weight goes up. So because of that the manufacturer has recommended

825
0:54:15,440000 --> 0:54:22,160000
that we avoid use in patients who have BMI of 30 or above and then also you know as we would see

826
0:54:22,160000 --> 0:54:28,160000
with most of them but especially these ones that have this increased VTE risk those cardiovascular

827
0:54:28,240000 --> 0:54:37,680000
events and smoking are also recommended to avoid. Lastly is Norgestral as the Opil. This is not a

828
0:54:37,680000 --> 0:54:44,800000
new drug but it's the first progestin available over the counter so it made it into the presentation

829
0:54:44,800000 --> 0:54:52,880000
because it has a new name. This was approved in July of 2023 so just a couple months ago and it's

830
0:54:52,880000 --> 0:54:57,840000
very exciting to kind of have our very first hormonal contraceptive that's available over the

831
0:54:57,840000 --> 0:55:04,560000
counter. A few things just to keep in mind with Norgestral is it has a very small forgiveness

832
0:55:04,560000 --> 0:55:10,560000
window when it comes to adherence. For any of us in the room who've maybe been on it before you

833
0:55:10,560000 --> 0:55:17,760000
at three hours that's it. So if you're more than three hours late taking your pill you do need to

834
0:55:17,840000 --> 0:55:26,720000
use a backup barrier method for 48 hours and then the other thing is it can be started at any time

835
0:55:26,720000 --> 0:55:31,520000
in the patient's cycle so that can be very convenient for patients they just need to use

836
0:55:31,520000 --> 0:55:37,760000
a backup barrier method for the first 48 hours that they start on it. One last thing about

837
0:55:37,760000 --> 0:55:45,520000
Norgestral and then I'll turn it over is it doesn't always prevent ovulation so in about 40%

838
0:55:45,600000 --> 0:55:53,200000
patients they still continue to ovulate so there is a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy seen with

839
0:55:53,200000 --> 0:55:59,120000
Norgestral compared to our combined hormonal contraceptives. So with that I will turn it over

840
0:55:59,120000 --> 0:56:04,160000
to Dr. Anderson for the next part of our presentation.

841
0:56:04,160000 --> 0:56:15,920000
Alright, hello everybody. Are you awake still?

842
0:56:19,280000 --> 0:56:27,280000
Alright so I'm going to dive into I will admit that I'm going to bring a lot of organ specific

843
0:56:27,280000 --> 0:56:33,280000
stuff into what I'm going to talk about. As mentioned the Dr. Kluna mentioned I had a lot of

844
0:56:34,560000 --> 0:56:40,720000
or I've done a lot of work with Oregon's protocol and you can actually download it right here

845
0:56:41,680000 --> 0:56:47,520000
and the reason I'm giving that to you is because if there is anybody who is wanting to be able to

846
0:56:47,520000 --> 0:56:53,680000
try and start this type of service and isn't quite sure where to start would like to work

847
0:56:53,680000 --> 0:56:59,760000
under a collaborative practice agreement. This protocol is available for free and it is something

848
0:56:59,840000 --> 0:57:05,680000
that is free to use even. There are actually a lot of other states that that's kind of where they

849
0:57:05,680000 --> 0:57:11,520000
have started with is with Oregon's protocol or some of the others that are out there now. We've

850
0:57:11,520000 --> 0:57:18,080000
got a lot to choose from at this point but part of why I put that up there is because when we get

851
0:57:18,080000 --> 0:57:24,480000
into the cases you're actually going to see the questionnaire that comes from our protocol and

852
0:57:24,480000 --> 0:57:30,240000
so that's where we're going to have you practice. The other thing that I want you to download how

853
0:57:30,240000 --> 0:57:38,640000
many have seen this app before? It's awesome isn't it? I load this app. I make my students

854
0:57:38,640000 --> 0:57:44,800000
download it and use it when we're practicing and when we get to practicing I highly recommend that

855
0:57:44,800000 --> 0:57:52,880000
you use this app. What it will do is go through all of those conditions that Dr. King brought up

856
0:57:52,880000 --> 0:58:00,640000
earlier and it will actually help you find what category it is and for the specific type of

857
0:58:00,640000 --> 0:58:06,800000
contraceptive contraception that you're looking for. The other thing you'll notice is that there is a

858
0:58:06,800000 --> 0:58:12,400000
companion guideline that goes with the MEC called the SPR. Actually I have a slide on it. It's called

859
0:58:12,400000 --> 0:58:18,720000
the standard practice recommendations and it goes hand in hand with the MEC to sort of round out

860
0:58:18,720000 --> 0:58:24,640000
the guidelines of seeing patients for contraception. So the MEC just goes over disease states. The

861
0:58:24,640000 --> 0:58:30,880000
SPR focuses more on management. So how are we going to see patients? What's important that we ask them

862
0:58:30,880000 --> 0:58:36,880000
that we look at? So for instance if we're going to prescribe combined hormonal contraceptives the

863
0:58:36,880000 --> 0:58:43,840000
SPR recommends that we get a blood pressure. The SPR also is where you go to find a lot of your

864
0:58:43,920000 --> 0:58:48,960000
counseling information. They have some really great resources for how to deal with missed pills,

865
0:58:48,960000 --> 0:58:56,480000
missed rings, things like that. And then finally there is a really great list of questions that you

866
0:58:56,480000 --> 0:59:03,520000
can use to help rule out a pregnancy. So you don't actually have to incorporate like a urine

867
0:59:03,520000 --> 0:59:08,480000
pregnancy test into your practice in order to be able to do that. You can actually use those

868
0:59:08,480000 --> 0:59:15,280000
questions and nearly all the states have some form of using those questions in their protocols.

869
0:59:16,800000 --> 0:59:21,280000
The other thing that we considered when we were developing our protocol was the fact that we

870
0:59:21,280000 --> 0:59:27,040000
have also the pharmacist patient care process that is standard everywhere for pharmacists to be able

871
0:59:27,040000 --> 0:59:31,600000
to follow. We're going to focus a little bit more on the assess but I'll also talk a little bit about

872
0:59:31,600000 --> 0:59:38,960000
the collection of what data we should be getting in order to assess it appropriately. So when we

873
0:59:38,960000 --> 0:59:45,200000
think about what we're assessing that ruling out a pregnancy, looking at the USMEC to find any

874
0:59:46,800000 --> 0:59:52,880000
medical conditions that might be contraindicated, and then asking a patient about preferences and

875
0:59:52,880000 --> 1:00:00
opinions. So what do we need to collect in order to assess that appropriately? So pregnancy, I already

876
1:00:00 --> 1:00:06,400000
brought up the urine pregnancy screening but there are these questions. I have them in another

877
1:00:06,400000 --> 1:00:13,200000
slide I believe. And then also getting that past medical history. A lot of these protocols have

878
1:00:13,200000 --> 1:00:19,600000
some type of questionnaire that we'll get at that. There is also getting blood pressure and if there

879
1:00:19,600000 --> 1:00:26,080000
is a medication list that you happen to have in your personal EMR, for that patient that would

880
1:00:26,080000 --> 1:00:32,400000
also be something to look at. History of contraception, there are options. What the patient has tried

881
1:00:32,400000 --> 1:00:38,640000
before is also going to be super helpful and important to find out. All right. So these are

882
1:00:38,640000 --> 1:00:44
some of the big steps on the assessment piece that come from our protocol. The first one is that

883
1:00:44 --> 1:00:48,640000
pregnancy screen that I mentioned. If you can rule out a pregnancy, you would go on to the next step

884
1:00:48,640000 --> 1:00:54,080000
which is looking at the MEC, looking for any of those contraindications, and then going to the next

885
1:00:54,080000 --> 1:00:59,120000
step for that blood pressure. Any of these points might be a place that you might need to refer but

886
1:00:59,120000 --> 1:01:04,960000
you'll also notice that for the blood pressure that's very specific to combined hormonal contraceptives.

887
1:01:05,600000 --> 1:01:11,200000
And if you do have somebody with a higher blood pressure, you could still consider a different

888
1:01:11,200000 --> 1:01:21,280000
progestering method depending because DMPA also has a blood pressure level. All right. So this is

889
1:01:21,280000 --> 1:01:27,680000
our example of a questionnaire. And I pulled out, you can hopefully see the dark pink coloration.

890
1:01:27,680000 --> 1:01:34,240000
That's our pregnancy screening questions. So these are a set of six questions that the SPR

891
1:01:35,280000 --> 1:01:39,600000
has in their guidelines and they have actually been validated to be able to

892
1:01:40,240000 --> 1:01:46,400000
rule out a pregnancy if the individual can answer yes to at least one of them. And so we've

893
1:01:46,560000 --> 1:01:52,720000
incorporated it into the questionnaire. And if you do have an individual that can answer yes,

894
1:01:52,720000 --> 1:01:58,560000
you would just keep going onto your next area. If they can't and you can't rule out a pregnancy,

895
1:01:58,560000 --> 1:02:06
that would be an indication to refer. The next one is checking that history. There's that MEC

896
1:02:06 --> 1:02:12,080000
table. But again, I'm going to have you guys try and practice with that app to also try and look

897
1:02:12,080000 --> 1:02:17,120000
through the MEC that way. If you ever find, at least for us in Oregon, I think this is the case

898
1:02:17,120000 --> 1:02:23,280000
for a lot of the statewide protocols, is that if you have somebody who has a condition that is a

899
1:02:23,280000 --> 1:02:28,160000
category three or four, that would be a referral. If it's a category one or two, you can go ahead

900
1:02:28,160000 --> 1:02:35,360000
and prescribe. All right. I think I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because Dr. King has

901
1:02:35,360000 --> 1:02:44,720000
also considered a lot of these things. And these are just counseling reminders, especially for

902
1:02:44,720000 --> 1:02:52,160000
initial oral contraceptive users. Again, this is found in the SPR, but making sure that you're

903
1:02:52,160000 --> 1:02:56,960000
counseling your patients on how to take it, that it is something that's taken at the same time

904
1:02:56,960000 --> 1:03:04,640000
every day. So there is that big adherence piece of it. And you'll notice kind of at the very end,

905
1:03:04,640000 --> 1:03:09,760000
goes and adherence a little bit more. How many of you guys have heard of the 12-month supply,

906
1:03:09,760000 --> 1:03:19,040000
if possible? Yeah, a few. A lot of states, Oregon included, have passed legislation that requires

907
1:03:19,040000 --> 1:03:24,240000
or mandates insurance companies to cover a full 12-month supply because we have some really great

908
1:03:24,240000 --> 1:03:30,400000
evidence that says adherence goes up if you can give a longer supply to individuals. So that's

909
1:03:30,400000 --> 1:03:35,520000
where that 12-month comes from. And we actually have incorporated that into our protocol to try

910
1:03:35,520000 --> 1:03:41,440000
and say that we should do that. In fact, we have some studies that have said that pharmacists are

911
1:03:41,440000 --> 1:03:46,320000
actually much more likely because we've done a lot of education, we included in our protocol.

912
1:03:46,320000 --> 1:03:52,240000
We're a lot more likely to dispense a much higher supply to individuals than other prescribers.

913
1:03:52,800000 --> 1:04:00,720000
All right, here's some of your adverse effects, broken down by estrogenic versus progestogenic.

914
1:04:01,680000 --> 1:04:06,080000
The one big one that you'll see that's common between the two is breakthrough bleeding.

915
1:04:06,640000 --> 1:04:11,840000
And so if you don't have enough of one or the other, you might end up seeing breakthrough bleeding.

916
1:04:11,840000 --> 1:04:18
That being said, anybody who's initiating on a combined oral contraceptive or progestent,

917
1:04:18,080000 --> 1:04:22
any really hormonal contraceptive is going to experience breakthrough bleeding.

918
1:04:22 --> 1:04:26,480000
It should get better. And so that's one of those things to talk to your patients about,

919
1:04:26,480000 --> 1:04:31,360000
that if they start experiencing that, try to give it some time, try to give it three months.

920
1:04:31,360000 --> 1:04:38,240000
And if it doesn't go away at that point, then try to reevaluate. I actually have a slide in just a bit

921
1:04:38,240000 --> 1:04:45,120000
on how to deal with that. I put a little question mark after headache under the estrogenic

922
1:04:45,920000 --> 1:04:51,600000
because I want you to consider that if you have a patient who has never been experiencing headaches

923
1:04:51,600000 --> 1:04:57,520000
before, suddenly starts experiencing them after they've started, especially on a combined oral

924
1:04:57,520000 --> 1:05:02,960000
contraceptive, that might be something to dig a little bit deeper into and make sure that we

925
1:05:02,960000 --> 1:05:12
don't need to stop that for them. All right, this is actually a chart that I developed with several

926
1:05:12 --> 1:05:18,480000
OBGYNs who helped us with developing our protocol and our training in Oregon. And this goes through

927
1:05:18,480000 --> 1:05:23,840000
how we would want to deal with somebody who is experiencing continued breakthrough bleeding.

928
1:05:23,840000 --> 1:05:30
So this is after that three months of somebody being on the method already, right? So first,

929
1:05:30 --> 1:05:33,600000
you're going to check for adherence. If that's something that they're having a problem with,

930
1:05:33,600000 --> 1:05:39,440000
then work on improving that with them, you could also talk to them about different methods,

931
1:05:40 --> 1:05:45,680000
in particular some long-acting methods. If they're saying that they have really great

932
1:05:45,680000 --> 1:05:51,760000
adherence, the other thing to check for is smoking status. And that just turns out to be something

933
1:05:51,760000 --> 1:05:59,840000
that interacts with hormonal contraceptives and can cause some spotting. So that would be another

934
1:05:59,840000 --> 1:06:05,600000
indication to try and work with your patient, hopefully to get them to stop smoking, especially

935
1:06:05,680000 --> 1:06:12
because as was shown earlier, that's a place in the MEC that as soon as they get above 35,

936
1:06:12,560000 --> 1:06:18,880000
we want to be stopping combined neural contraceptives anyway. If that is negative as well,

937
1:06:18,880000 --> 1:06:25,840000
that might be an indication to refer to the PCP. You don't need to stop the method. And in fact,

938
1:06:25,840000 --> 1:06:31,600000
if you want to try and see if they are at one of those lower doses of ethyl esterdyl,

939
1:06:31,600000 --> 1:06:37,680000
you could increase that. You could also try changing the progester to see if that will help

940
1:06:37,680000 --> 1:06:44,320000
with the breakthrough bleeding. But the reason we kind of put that referral in there, that was

941
1:06:44,320000 --> 1:06:50,560000
actually requested by our OBGYNs, they wanted to make sure pharmacists were always sending people

942
1:06:50,560000 --> 1:06:58,160000
to get just checked out in case there was anything concerning. All right, I'm going to spend just

943
1:06:58,240000 --> 1:07:03,200000
a tiny bit more time on other clinical situations and then we'll dive into our cases. How is everyone

944
1:07:03,200000 --> 1:07:13,600000
doing? Still with me? Awesome. All right, Acne, here's a tism, here's a tism is where you have a lot

945
1:07:13,600000 --> 1:07:21,440000
of excess androgens and therefore symptoms that occur with that. And it turns out that anything

946
1:07:21,440000 --> 1:07:29,040000
that has an estrogen component in it will reduce androgens. So we actually have some combined

947
1:07:29,040000 --> 1:07:35,920000
oral contraceptives that have an additional FDA approval to treat Acne. So if you happen to have

948
1:07:35,920000 --> 1:07:43,200000
somebody who has Acne wants to be started on a contraceptive method, this may actually be something

949
1:07:43,200000 --> 1:07:48,640000
that you move a little bit or are thinking more towards as long as they don't have any other

950
1:07:48,640000 --> 1:07:54,800000
contraindications to that estrogen. The other thing is we just talked about how we now have

951
1:07:54,800000 --> 1:08:01,120000
several different types of progestinone pills and one of them happens to have an anti-androgen

952
1:08:01,120000 --> 1:08:07,120000
progestin, right? So that one is actually going to help with Acne whereas the other one could in

953
1:08:07,120000 --> 1:08:12,400000
fact make Acne worse. So that would be the one that you would choose if you're going to go the

954
1:08:12,480000 --> 1:08:20,320000
progestin only route. The next one is heavy or painful periods. You may actually see people be

955
1:08:20,320000 --> 1:08:27,520000
put on continuous oral contraceptives in order to kind of help with not even having periods so that

956
1:08:27,520000 --> 1:08:33,920000
they don't have to deal with those painful heavy periods. The other thing that you might see is a

957
1:08:33,920000 --> 1:08:40,480000
progestinone method. For those that know or can think back in school with their pharmacology and

958
1:08:40,480000 --> 1:08:48,080000
the mechanism of how progestin works, progestins, and this is actually not a contraceptive

959
1:08:48,080000 --> 1:08:54
mechanism piece, it's just something that happens to do, it will thin out the endometrial lining

960
1:08:54,560000 --> 1:09:01,600000
over time. And because it does that, it will actually make it so your periods are lighter and

961
1:09:01,600000 --> 1:09:07,120000
less painful. So that may also be something or a route that you go. And in fact,

962
1:09:07,120000 --> 1:09:16,720000
leavenor gestural IUDs have that as an indication from the FDA. PMDD is something that you see where

963
1:09:16,720000 --> 1:09:24,160000
the symptoms occur because of that cycle and changes in hormones. If that's the case, some

964
1:09:24,160000 --> 1:09:30,560000
individuals may actually be helped by using continuous contraception. So there's another place where

965
1:09:30,560000 --> 1:09:38,400000
you might see continuous contraceptives used. And then the other thing to mention is to avoid

966
1:09:38,400000 --> 1:09:43,920000
those phasics. Does anybody know what the phasics are? We didn't kind of go into those at all. But

967
1:09:43,920000 --> 1:09:51,440000
that's where the doses of either estrogen or in most cases the progestin changes throughout the month

968
1:09:51,440000 --> 1:09:58,720000
or the cycle. And because those are changing and we believe that PMDD is caused by those adjustments

969
1:09:58,720000 --> 1:10:07,360000
in hormones, we want to avoid those. The next one is that PCOS, we do often see it used or

970
1:10:07,360000 --> 1:10:11,680000
combined hormonal contraceptives. I already talked about the hearsuitism up above. That's

971
1:10:11,680000 --> 1:10:20,480000
something you very frequently see in PCOS. And so we often see this used in that condition. If it's

972
1:10:20,480000 --> 1:10:26,720000
something that you're using for infertility, especially if you have somebody who is not regular

973
1:10:26,720000 --> 1:10:34,400000
or in a cycle at all, you may actually see that they get put onto some type of contraception in

974
1:10:34,400000 --> 1:10:39,840000
order to get them into a cycle. Because when you get into those placebo pills, they will get what's

975
1:10:39,840000 --> 1:10:46,880000
called a withdrawal bleed and suddenly you have a cycle again. The last one is breastfeeding. This

976
1:10:46,880000 --> 1:10:54,560000
actually has its own category within the MEC. And I think we have several cases to be considered

977
1:10:54,640000 --> 1:11:01,520000
when it comes to breastfeeding. So I just wanted to mention this real quickly. CHCs and estrogen

978
1:11:01,520000 --> 1:11:07,040000
are only thought to affect the initial production of milk. So if you look in the MEC, it actually

979
1:11:07,040000 --> 1:11:14,880000
says that after the first month as long as there's no other risks for VTE and that's its other

980
1:11:14,880000 --> 1:11:23,200000
separate risk in that first initial month, then you can actually start using CHCs. So after somebody

981
1:11:23,200000 --> 1:11:32,160000
has gotten past at least the first month and they don't have other indicators for VTE risk,

982
1:11:32,160000 --> 1:11:40,480000
you can go to a combined method if they would like to. All right. Any questions on any of what

983
1:11:40,480000 --> 1:11:52,400000
we've talked about so far before I dive into the cases? All right. Has everybody been able to find

984
1:11:52,400000 --> 1:12:01,280000
the handout that is along with our for this session? So I don't believe it's in with the schedule

985
1:12:01,840000 --> 1:12:08,160000
or itinerary. You have to go into a different section whereas for the resources for this session

986
1:12:08,160000 --> 1:12:13,840000
in order to find our slides. And then at the very, very bottom are a whole bunch of different

987
1:12:13,840000 --> 1:12:20,960000
questionnaires. Has everybody been able to find them? Give me a thumbs up when you are able to find

988
1:12:20,960000 --> 1:12:43,600000
those cases. All right. When you do find those cases, this is what it will look like. So this is

989
1:12:43,600000 --> 1:12:49,440000
an example of one of them and there's actually two pages per questionnaire. So this is the

990
1:12:49,440000 --> 1:12:54,800000
questionnaire I mentioned earlier that comes from the Oregon statewide protocol. And what we've

991
1:12:54,800000 --> 1:13:01,200000
done is kind of given you your cases within these questionnaires. Try to give you more information

992
1:13:01,200000 --> 1:13:08
if it's needed. So in some, for instance, you might see that there's like a weight given. Also,

993
1:13:08 --> 1:13:13,520000
this one I think there's more information needed if the patient says yes to having diabetes. And then

994
1:13:14,480000 --> 1:13:22,960000
what we want you to do in your groups or individually is to go through these patient cases for the next

995
1:13:22,960000 --> 1:13:28,560000
10 minutes or so. And then we are going to go through them with sli-do so that you're going to be

996
1:13:28,560000 --> 1:13:34
answering the questions. So be thinking through that. And here's sort of the questions that you

997
1:13:34 --> 1:13:41,760000
want to be thinking about as you go through these cases. Can pregnancy be ruled out? Do they have a

998
1:13:41,760000 --> 1:13:48,320000
preference in method? And if they do, is that a preference or is that method something that we

999
1:13:48,320000 --> 1:13:56,320000
can prescribe for them? And then are you able to prescribe what they want in terms of like checking

1000
1:13:56,320000 --> 1:14:02,480000
their blood pressure, looking through all of their MEC categories and that sort of thing?

1001
1:14:03,120000 --> 1:14:05,840000
Are there questions before I turn you loose?

1002
1:14:05,840000 --> 1:14:14,160000
All right. You have about 10 minutes.

1003
1:14:36,400000 --> 1:14:48
Sorry to interrupt real quick. I forgot to mention the numbers. So at the top of each

1004
1:14:48 --> 1:14:54,080000
questionnaire, you're going to notice a number and they are out of order. So just be aware,

1005
1:14:54,080000 --> 1:14:58,960000
we will be going in order through them, but currently in the handout, they're out of order.

1006
1:14:58,960000 --> 1:15:14,880000
But there are, I believe, six cases total.

1007
1:19:59,200000 --> 1:20:04,880000
All right, everyone. How are we doing? Where are we at? Are you about through? Awesome. Okay.

1008
1:20:05,440000 --> 1:20:13,280000
So we will go ahead and get started with the cases. So we'll start with case one. I'm like

1009
1:20:13,280000 --> 1:20:18,480000
Dr. Anderson was alluding to. It should be a big black number in the corner of the case. Okay.

1010
1:20:18,480000 --> 1:20:23,600000
So this is our 22-year-old female wants to start on an oral hormonal contraceptive.

1011
1:20:23,600000 --> 1:20:27,920000
As you see, you have the case in front of you, so I won't read all of it off. But things that

1012
1:20:27,920000 --> 1:20:33,360000
are pertinent here, she is single, but dating approximately one sexual partner in the past month

1013
1:20:33,360000 --> 1:20:38,320000
does deny any smoking as well as recreational drugs. Her past medical history is consistent

1014
1:20:38,320000 --> 1:20:44,960000
with migraines with aura, and she does take stumatryptin as needed for the migraines. Her blood pressure

1015
1:20:44,960000 --> 1:20:52,640000
here, 122 over 80, the weight is not non-factor in this equation. So what did you guys recommend

1016
1:20:52,640000 --> 1:21:00,160000
for this patient to start? This is a select all that applies situation, so please feel free to

1017
1:21:00,160000 --> 1:21:02,160000
pick more than one answer.

1018
1:21:02,160000 --> 1:21:31,520000
All right. So it looks like the majority of you said C and D.

1019
1:21:31,520000 --> 1:21:36,720000
So just bare known or the north syndrome. Perfect. Very good. We have a couple answers for the

1020
1:21:36,720000 --> 1:21:41,600000
sprint tech and a couple answers for the yes. So to kind of break this down, sorry about the

1021
1:21:41,600000 --> 1:21:46,560000
boxes that did not come up in the right order. However, if we go and we look at our mech here,

1022
1:21:46,560000 --> 1:21:51,280000
we see that the big indicator for this patient is the migraine with aura. Okay. So when looking

1023
1:21:51,280000 --> 1:21:56,640000
at our key, we see that this categorizes in terms of our combined hormonal contraceptives as a

1024
1:21:56,720000 --> 1:22:01,440000
category four, so an unacceptable health risk. I also want to make sure that we understand what

1025
1:22:01,440000 --> 1:22:06,480000
a migraine with aura is. Okay. So it's also called a classic migraine. It's a recurring headache

1026
1:22:06,480000 --> 1:22:12,080000
that strikes after or at the same time as a sensory disturbance called the aura. Okay. So that's what

1027
1:22:12,080000 --> 1:22:15,840000
we need to be looking at for these patients. If they've ever had it, we really should not be putting

1028
1:22:15,840000 --> 1:22:20,720000
them on combined hormonal contraception. With that being said, you guys got it. I don't believe I

1029
1:22:20,720000 --> 1:22:24,880000
can go back to the pool slide, but it should be that your spheranone or the north syndrome for

1030
1:22:24,960000 --> 1:22:29,360000
this patient. Some other things that we could consider in narrowing down between the two,

1031
1:22:29,360000 --> 1:22:33,520000
potentially. If the patient was complaining of things like acne and stuff like that,

1032
1:22:33,520000 --> 1:22:39,520000
you might want to go with the drosparanone over the other medication due to some of the anti-entrinergic

1033
1:22:39,520000 --> 1:22:43,760000
effects. Yeah.

1034
1:22:43,760000 --> 1:22:48,080000
I'm not really quite sure.

1035
1:22:52 --> 1:22:56,480000
So we discussed that those two participants only pills would be good options for her. And then we

1036
1:22:56,480000 --> 1:23:02,480000
discussed that with a drosparanone, is there that increased risk for clot and therefore stroke

1037
1:23:02,480000 --> 1:23:08,960000
with someone with migraine auras? What was that last part? The increased risk of stroke,

1038
1:23:08,960000 --> 1:23:13,040000
you know, clot and the subsequent stroke and a person with migraine with auras. Right. And is

1039
1:23:13,040000 --> 1:23:18,800000
a drosparanone then not a great option or is it still a safe option?

1040
1:23:25,120000 --> 1:23:33,360000
Dr. Anitin there. There you go. So I will say technically if you're looking at the MEC,

1041
1:23:33,360000 --> 1:23:39,680000
it would fit under the PLP, but like we were mentioning, that was done in 2016. Drosparanone has

1042
1:23:39,680000 --> 1:23:45,840000
been added since then. So I don't think we have a lot of clear guidance on what to do with that.

1043
1:23:46,640000 --> 1:23:53,360000
I think you do see though, like remember how there's like an initiating and a continuation.

1044
1:23:53,360000 --> 1:24:00,160000
So PLPs, I believe they have like an initiation is okay if there's a history of stroke, but if you

1045
1:24:00,160000 --> 1:24:08
experience a stroke while you're on it, you would need to stop it. So I'm not exactly sure if that's

1046
1:24:08,080000 --> 1:24:13,280000
going to include drosparanone. I hope in the future we'll have more clarity on that.

1047
1:24:14,480000 --> 1:24:20,480000
Sorry. Thank you for the question. So we will move forward to our next case scenario. So this is

1048
1:24:20,480000 --> 1:24:26,080000
IJ, our 38 year old female. She also filled out our screening contraception intake form. The last

1049
1:24:26,080000 --> 1:24:30,960000
period was two and a half weeks ago. Currently has been taking sprint tech, so an or decimate

1050
1:24:30,960000 --> 1:24:36,800000
ethanol estradiol. She states that she's married with the two kids. She does smoke a pack per day,

1051
1:24:36,800000 --> 1:24:41,280000
denies any recreational use of drugs and just drinks socially. She doesn't have any

1052
1:24:41,280000 --> 1:24:46,480000
past medical history worth mentioning as well as not is not actively on any medications or does

1053
1:24:46,480000 --> 1:24:52,080000
not have any allergies. So what do you guys think about this one? What do you think is an

1054
1:24:52,080000 --> 1:24:57,280000
appropriate step initially after reviewing her intake for? Would you continue her on the sprint

1055
1:24:57,280000 --> 1:25:01,440000
tech? Would you refer her to a primary care physician at this point due to something that

1056
1:25:01,440000 --> 1:25:04,960000
alarmed you in the case? Or would you do you think that we would be able to switch her to a

1057
1:25:04,960000 --> 1:25:09,520000
different oral hormonal contraceptive that might work better for her in her past medical history

1058
1:25:09,520000 --> 1:25:13,680000
or potentially something else that you saw within the case?

1059
1:25:23,360000 --> 1:25:26,160000
All right. Awesome. Looks like we have about 18 a.m. So we'll go ahead.

1060
1:25:26,800000 --> 1:25:31,360000
And great. So the majority of you said to switch to a different oral hormonal contraception.

1061
1:25:31,440000 --> 1:25:35,360000
And I do believe, I do agree with you on all of that. She did state that she would like to stay

1062
1:25:35,360000 --> 1:25:40,720000
on an oral formulation. And based on her case, I do believe that within many of our

1063
1:25:40,720000 --> 1:25:46,080000
consult agreements or within what we were doing here in terms of our worksheet, it is within a

1064
1:25:46,080000 --> 1:25:51,120000
pharmacist scope to switch the medication. So if we look here, we have our options. And I'll go

1065
1:25:51,120000 --> 1:25:54,720000
ahead and let you put in your answers for that.

1066
1:26:10 --> 1:26:14,960000
All right. Looks like we got about 15 answers. So we'll go ahead. Awesome. Good job. 100%. So

1067
1:26:14,960000 --> 1:26:20,640000
North Endrone would be the preferred therapy for this patient. Moving on to our debrief.

1068
1:26:20,720000 --> 1:26:24,880000
Again, we see that she was smoking, right? She was smoking over a pack per day. That's equivalent to

1069
1:26:24,880000 --> 1:26:30,160000
over 20 cigarettes per day. She also falls into the age category of she's 38 years old. So she's

1070
1:26:30,160000 --> 1:26:37,200000
older than 35. Making her fall into the unacceptable health risk category to continue a combined oral

1071
1:26:37,200000 --> 1:26:42
contraception. So she preferred to stay on oral therapy. So we do have the options of switching

1072
1:26:42 --> 1:26:48,720000
her over to a projection only pill. And with that, I'll hand it off to Dr. King who's going to do the

1073
1:26:48,720000 --> 1:26:55,760000
case three and four. Thank you. All right. So for scenario three, we have EF who's a 20-year-old

1074
1:26:55,760000 --> 1:27:02,400000
female who filled out the self-screening. And she marked that today was the day of last day,

1075
1:27:03,120000 --> 1:27:10,480000
the date of her period. And she reports consistently using condoms. She has preferred contraceptive

1076
1:27:10,480000 --> 1:27:16,400000
options of vaginal ring, IUD or implant. She does report changes in vaginal bleeding,

1077
1:27:16,400000 --> 1:27:22,320000
no health insurance. Past medical history includes diabetes and migraines but denies ORA's.

1078
1:27:22,880000 --> 1:27:29,680000
And her blood pressure is listed there for you. So for our first question for scenario three,

1079
1:27:29,680000 --> 1:27:42,960000
based off the self-screening form, which contraceptive best aligns with EF's preferences and is safe?

1080
1:27:46,400000 --> 1:28:05,360000
All righty. So a lot of you guys said referring to the gynecologist for an IUD,

1081
1:28:06,240000 --> 1:28:10,880000
which is definitely an option as well. If the patient's really looking to work with you as

1082
1:28:10,960000 --> 1:28:18,400000
the pharmacist, we could also consider the suggestion as to ethanol estradiol.

1083
1:28:19,360000 --> 1:28:24,800000
I'm guessing the reason why more of you did not necessarily pick this option was perhaps because

1084
1:28:24,800000 --> 1:28:32,240000
of the migraines or the migraines. But we'll talk about that more in a minute. And then which

1085
1:28:32,240000 --> 1:28:36,240000
factors exclude this patient from using the progestant implant?

1086
1:28:40,880000 --> 1:28:59,120000
All righty. Great. Most of you got that with the changes in vaginal bleeding.

1087
1:29:00,080000 --> 1:29:05,840000
So to focus on, you know, why we were getting to where we were. So first, if we start,

1088
1:29:06,720000 --> 1:29:12,880000
the patient has diabetes, but she's not on insulin. So we see where all of those options

1089
1:29:12,880000 --> 1:29:18,640000
are available as a one or a two. So that's something we could still consider. She does have migraines,

1090
1:29:18,640000 --> 1:29:24,480000
but does not have ORA's. So again, that leaves kind of everything open for us. And then lastly,

1091
1:29:24,480000 --> 1:29:32,800000
we have that unexplained vaginal bleeding. And so that does exclude the implants and then the

1092
1:29:32,800000 --> 1:29:41,040000
initiation of the IUDs as well. So for those reasons, based off of the options that were selected,

1093
1:29:42,080000 --> 1:29:48,960000
it would be reasonable to try the anavirring for the patient. If the migraines worsened or

1094
1:29:48,960000 --> 1:29:54,800000
the headache's worsened, then that would absolutely be a time for for sure a referral.

1095
1:29:55,360000 --> 1:29:58,640000
It looks like we have a question. Just have a question. So one of the things we were talking

1096
1:29:58,640000 --> 1:30:05,520000
about was the fact that it said she didn't have insurance. And so how does the anavirra

1097
1:30:05,520000 --> 1:30:11,040000
become a cost effective option for her? Where our thought process was maybe we could refer her to

1098
1:30:11,040000 --> 1:30:17,760000
a local title 10 clinic, where the cost for the IUD may be a bit more reasonable over the length

1099
1:30:17,760000 --> 1:30:23,840000
of therapy. Also the fact that she does have that vaginal bleeding that's concerning to her,

1100
1:30:24,320000 --> 1:30:28,720000
we would want to investigate that a little bit further. So if you could just add any thoughts

1101
1:30:28,720000 --> 1:30:35,120000
related to those points, we'd appreciate it. Yeah. So my point, my thought process as far as the

1102
1:30:35,120000 --> 1:30:41,920000
insurance goes is, you know, likely whether it's an IUD, the implant or even the anavirra, there

1103
1:30:41,920000 --> 1:30:48
is going to be an upfront cost associated with that. The nice thing with the anavirring is it is

1104
1:30:48 --> 1:30:53,600000
only a one-time cost per year. So it's not something where she's going to be having to pay for it.

1105
1:30:53,600000 --> 1:30:58,560000
Every month, like it would be with, let's say, the anavirring or one of the patches or something

1106
1:30:58,560000 --> 1:31:03,680000
like that. As far as the vaginal bleeding, I think it would be something to kind of dig in a little

1107
1:31:03,680000 --> 1:31:11,280000
bit more. But it doesn't necessarily preclude you as a pharmacist from at least starting a

1108
1:31:11,280000 --> 1:31:16,560000
contraceptive. It doesn't mean that you still wouldn't also refer the patient for further work

1109
1:31:16,560000 --> 1:31:21,040000
up and evaluation, but it doesn't necessarily prevent you from being able to start her on

1110
1:31:21,040000 --> 1:31:27,440000
something initially. And Dr. Anderson can add. I thought I'd also mention something about the

1111
1:31:27,440000 --> 1:31:34,240000
vaginal bleeding piece. We actually originally, in our very first protocol and questionnaire,

1112
1:31:34,240000 --> 1:31:42
iteration did not have that question being asked because of the fact that the methods at the time

1113
1:31:42 --> 1:31:49,200000
that we could use, which were only the pills in the patch, were not contraindicated. And so when

1114
1:31:49,280000 --> 1:31:56
we got depot or the DMPA injection, we had to go back through the MEC to see if there was anything

1115
1:31:56 --> 1:32:03,200000
we were missing. And that was it. So we then therefore started including that question in the

1116
1:32:03,200000 --> 1:32:10,720000
questionnaire. So you're, but I will say, I think your concern is completely warranted. And I would

1117
1:32:10,720000 --> 1:32:16,240000
say anybody that answers yes to that question, I would always refer. It doesn't mean that you

1118
1:32:16,240000 --> 1:32:22,240000
can't give them something, but please refer if they have any concerns about vaginal bleeding at

1119
1:32:22,240000 --> 1:32:31,040000
all, they should go get that checked out. Thank you. All right. So for scenario four, we have

1120
1:32:31,040000 --> 1:32:38,080000
VW who's a 29 year old female who filled out the screening form. Her last visit to the reproductive

1121
1:32:38,080000 --> 1:32:44,960000
clinic was two years ago. She has been on hormonal contraceptives in the past. She does have diabetes

1122
1:32:44,960000 --> 1:32:52,160000
and she had a ruined why. And I have her vitals and weight, including BMI of 31 listed there.

1123
1:32:53,600000 --> 1:33:00,880000
Based off of the screening form is VW able to start on a hormonal contraceptive pill.

1124
1:33:01,040000 --> 1:33:19,360000
All right. So everybody said no. That is correct. And we'll go into why in just a minute,

1125
1:33:20 --> 1:33:25,680000
which alternative hormonal contraceptive would be appropriate for VW and you can select all that

1126
1:33:25,680000 --> 1:33:27,680000
apply.

1127
1:33:27,680000 --> 1:33:57,360000
Okay. So we got a wide array, mostly focused on IUD

1128
1:33:57,360000 --> 1:34:06,160000
implant and the DMPI. So specifically for this patient, she does have a BMI greater than 30.

1129
1:34:06,160000 --> 1:34:12
So we do need to be aware of that with some of our products. And then she also had a ruined

1130
1:34:12 --> 1:34:19,600000
why procedure, which is a malabsorptive procedure, gastric bypass, which does list our progesterone

1131
1:34:19,600000 --> 1:34:26,160000
only pills as well as our combined oral contraceptives as a level three.

1132
1:34:28,080000 --> 1:34:34,800000
So because of this, we would not necessarily be able to initiate any of our pill options,

1133
1:34:34,800000 --> 1:34:40,240000
which everybody got. And then as far as the ring and the implant, there is data out there

1134
1:34:40,800000 --> 1:34:46,480000
similar to what we have discussed with a lot of the products today, where we are either lacking

1135
1:34:46,480000 --> 1:34:54
information regarding patients with a BMI above 30 or there's decreased efficacy or increased risk

1136
1:34:54 --> 1:35:00,480000
of BTE. And so that is what we're seeing with both of our combined hormonal contraceptive rings,

1137
1:35:00,480000 --> 1:35:06,160000
as well as the implant, which I know we didn't go over today since it wasn't a newer product,

1138
1:35:06,160000 --> 1:35:12,160000
but it does have decreased efficacy when patients have an ideal body weight less than 100 or over

1139
1:35:12,560000 --> 1:35:18,960000
130% of their ideal body weight. So just a few kind of unique aspects when it comes to selecting

1140
1:35:18,960000 --> 1:35:24,160000
these products that we may need to think through. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dr. Anderson

1141
1:35:24,160000 --> 1:35:25,760000
for our last two scenarios.

1142
1:35:32,240000 --> 1:35:37,920000
All right. Scenario five was a 20-year-old who filled out

1143
1:35:38,560000 --> 1:35:47,520000
that her last period has been a little while since she gave birth to a baby 14 days ago and has been breastfeeding.

1144
1:35:47,520000 --> 1:35:53,840000
She reports that she's not currently using contraception but has used it in the past and that her preferred

1145
1:35:53,840000 --> 1:36:00,960000
method is the vaginal ring. No health insurance, so that may play into it. Past medical history is not

1146
1:36:01,040000 --> 1:36:08,640000
significant. It has prenatal vitamins, omega-3s. Blood pressure today is 118 number 68.

1147
1:36:09,200000 --> 1:36:14,160000
All right. So based on the screening form, K.L. would like to be started on a vaginal ring.

1148
1:36:14,160000 --> 1:36:23,040000
Is this an appropriate option?

1149
1:36:31,520000 --> 1:36:35,440000
All right. The answer is in fact no.

1150
1:36:37,600000 --> 1:36:42,240000
We'll go over wine just a bit. As the pharmacist with the clinic, you work under collaborative

1151
1:36:42,240000 --> 1:36:49,760000
practice agreement to be able to prescribe or and or administer the different methods that are listed.

1152
1:36:50,320000 --> 1:36:56,800000
So select all the methods that could be prescribed for K.L. at this time.

1153
1:37:00,960000 --> 1:37:23,520000
All right.

1154
1:37:23,520000 --> 1:37:30,480000
So it is just our progester only method. So anything that has estrogen in it, we would want to avoid

1155
1:37:30,480000 --> 1:37:36,800000
for this individual. And here is your reasons why we have actually two things that we're looking

1156
1:37:36,800000 --> 1:37:46
at. It's that breastfeeding piece, but there's also an area right after birth within especially

1157
1:37:46 --> 1:37:54,960000
the first 21 days where individuals are really high risk for getting VTEs way more than you see

1158
1:37:54,960000 --> 1:38:01,360000
with combined hormonal contraceptives more than you see with even pregnancy. And so they

1159
1:38:01,360000 --> 1:38:08,400000
should not be on any kind of combined method at least for 21 days. And there's even like a debate

1160
1:38:08,400000 --> 1:38:17,360000
between a little bit after that if there are any risk factors. So this would pose an unacceptable

1161
1:38:17,360000 --> 1:38:25,120000
risk right at this moment. All right. Scenario six and then we'll be we're getting close. RS is

1162
1:38:25,680000 --> 1:38:33,360000
27 and she doesn't remember the last day she had a period. She has a three and a half month old

1163
1:38:33,360000 --> 1:38:38,160000
baby that she's been fully or nearly fully breastfeeding. So another breastfeeding situation,

1164
1:38:38,160000 --> 1:38:44,880000
but we're much further out from when the baby has been born. And she has not started having

1165
1:38:44,880000 --> 1:38:50
periods again. She purrs that she is not currently using contraception and has never been on a

1166
1:38:50 --> 1:38:56
hormonal method before. RS's preferred method would be to start on a pill. Her past medical

1167
1:38:56 --> 1:39:01,520000
history when she goes through the questionnaire includes gestational diabetes, migraine headaches

1168
1:39:01,520000 --> 1:39:09,600000
without Ora's and bipolar. So she takes the motrogen does not have any allergies and her blood pressure

1169
1:39:09,600000 --> 1:39:18,720000
today is 128 over 76. All right. So in clarifying what type of oral pill RS would like to start,

1170
1:39:18,720000 --> 1:39:24,320000
she indicates that she would like one that contains both estrogen and progestin. So a combined oral

1171
1:39:24,320000 --> 1:39:36,960000
pill. Given this information, would it be appropriate to prescribe a COC for RS?

1172
1:39:40,480000 --> 1:39:56,640000
All right. Nice job. All right. We'll get into the reasons in just a bit. So here's your methods

1173
1:39:56,640000 --> 1:40:11,520000
again. Mark all that you would be able to prescribe for RS.

1174
1:40:27,280000 --> 1:40:48,320000
Nice. Good job. You guys did get the progestin only pill. And is the progestin injection. So

1175
1:40:49,360000 --> 1:40:54,640000
the big things on here that we actually had quite a few, right? We're starting to get a lot more

1176
1:40:54,640000 --> 1:40:58,720000
things that they're saying yes to. Does that mean we add them up? Does anybody know?

1177
1:40:59,920000 --> 1:41:05,360000
Correct. Yeah. No, we don't. They're each their own individual thing that you would just look at

1178
1:41:05,360000 --> 1:41:12
to see if you ever run into a category three or four. And so here's our different conditions

1179
1:41:12 --> 1:41:16,960000
that we were looking over. The first one was diabetes. She had the history of diabetes,

1180
1:41:16,960000 --> 1:41:23,600000
so no longer does. And so in that case, we're not concerned. Next one was breastfeeding. She's

1181
1:41:23,680000 --> 1:41:30
passed that 42 days postpartum that we were discussing. So that's not a concern either.

1182
1:41:30 --> 1:41:36,480000
The headaches, the migraines, she doesn't have auras. So again, not concerned. But the big one

1183
1:41:36,480000 --> 1:41:43,040000
that started popping up was the lomotrigine, right? Does anybody know what the interaction is there?

1184
1:41:43,520000 --> 1:41:55,760000
So in nearly every one of the cases for medications, and you can kind of see a little bit above it,

1185
1:41:55,760000 --> 1:42:02,480000
where it talks about fenetone, carbon-masipine, barbiturates, that sort of thing, those actually

1186
1:42:02,480000 --> 1:42:08,960000
all decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. And you'll actually see that that goes for both

1187
1:42:08,960000 --> 1:42:16,400000
the POP and the CHC. But for whatever reason, the mochrigine does not interact with the

1188
1:42:16,400000 --> 1:42:23,280000
progesterone only pill or progesterone only methods in general. It actually gets decreased. So it

1189
1:42:23,280000 --> 1:42:30,160000
has no effect on the CHC. What it's doing is decreasing the levels of the lomotrigine in that

1190
1:42:30,160000 --> 1:42:34,880000
case. So it's doing the opposite of what the others were doing, which was decreasing levels of the

1191
1:42:35,760000 --> 1:42:43,200000
contraceptives, which would give us concern. We don't want to have any efficacy reduced with our

1192
1:42:43,200000 --> 1:42:50
contraceptives. But lomotrigine, you actually, I mean, as the pharmacist, if you are working under

1193
1:42:50 --> 1:42:54,640000
like a statewide protocol or even a protocol that just says you're not allowed to prescribe for three

1194
1:42:54,640000 --> 1:43:00,800000
or four, then in that case, you wouldn't be able to use a CHC. But you actually will see some groups

1195
1:43:00,880000 --> 1:43:06,400000
or doctors out there that will just increase the dose of the lomotrigine and still give them a CHC.

1196
1:43:07,120000 --> 1:43:12,160000
So just kind of keep that in mind that that's what the interaction is doing. You as a pharmacist

1197
1:43:12,160000 --> 1:43:17,200000
wouldn't be able to do the CHC, but a POP would be appropriate in this case. Does that make sense?

1198
1:43:18,400000 --> 1:43:27,840000
Okay. Awesome. All right. And now we are down to questions. Looks like we've got some. All right,

1199
1:43:27,840000 --> 1:43:33,920000
so our first one is CDC, MEC, and SPR does not include weight in their guidance. They do.

1200
1:43:36 --> 1:43:43,840000
I would be willing to bet, however, that we are going to see more in this space because we didn't

1201
1:43:43,840000 --> 1:43:50,640000
have a lot of good evidence. And we're starting to get a lot more studies that are indicating that

1202
1:43:50,640000 --> 1:43:57,200000
there may be concerns, that there may be recommendations with that. I think you had one of the slides

1203
1:43:57,200000 --> 1:44:06,480000
that brought up the obesity part. Yeah. So with the weight, you know, it seems like a lot of the

1204
1:44:06,480000 --> 1:44:16,880000
drug studies are starting to look at that kind of on an individual basis. And so I would expect

1205
1:44:16,880000 --> 1:44:23,840000
that there may be additional information coming, you know, for right now with the obesity data that

1206
1:44:23,920000 --> 1:44:30,480000
is included in the US MEC, it is just a level two. So I mean, I think at that point you would need

1207
1:44:30,480000 --> 1:44:38,240000
to look at the individual product. From what I found, the package inserts are specific to each

1208
1:44:38,240000 --> 1:44:45,280000
individual drug and very clearly lay out, you know, why it is that recommendation. So then you could

1209
1:44:45,280000 --> 1:44:50,400000
determine with your patient, you know, whether or not that's something that is, is it concerned

1210
1:44:50,400000 --> 1:44:57,920000
for them or not? And you will notice, I'm sure you probably did, that the questionnaire that we

1211
1:44:57,920000 --> 1:45:04,480000
have in Oregon doesn't actually have a section for weight, which is kind of interesting. And I think

1212
1:45:04,480000 --> 1:45:11,360000
that is because there are no contraindications based on weight, that being said, like we've kind of

1213
1:45:11,360000 --> 1:45:16
talked over today, I do think it's something that we're going to start seeing more and more of. And

1214
1:45:16 --> 1:45:23,040000
I do think it's a consideration. It's not necessarily included in the protocols though. All right,

1215
1:45:23,040000 --> 1:45:30,880000
what contraceptive options exist for someone who is AFAB, which I believe stands for assigned

1216
1:45:30,880000 --> 1:45:38,400000
female at birth and taking testosterone for gender affirming care. And that's an absolutely great

1217
1:45:38,400000 --> 1:45:44,800000
question. We didn't get into that today. So apologies that we didn't get into transgender care. But

1218
1:45:45,520000 --> 1:45:54
what I think a lot of those individuals are concerned about is taking the estrogen-progestion type

1219
1:45:54 --> 1:46:01,360000
components, right, with that testosterone. So I do believe a lot of individuals or health care

1220
1:46:01,360000 --> 1:46:08,560000
providers will steer more towards your non-hormonal options. So maybe a copper IUD would be a fabulous

1221
1:46:08,560000 --> 1:46:14,400000
option for that. The leave-and-orgestral IUDs, I would actually say those are also an option because

1222
1:46:14,480000 --> 1:46:20,720000
they have that localized effect and they don't get systemic. So that would also be another option.

1223
1:46:21,440000 --> 1:46:25,760000
And they don't have interactions because of the fact that it doesn't get systemic.

1224
1:46:28,080000 --> 1:46:33,120000
Yeah, I was going to echo that because with most of the leave-and-orgestral IUDs,

1225
1:46:33,840000 --> 1:46:40,320000
there's a high rate of amenorrhea that develops, especially in the third and fourth and fifth year

1226
1:46:40,320000 --> 1:46:45,200000
that an individual would have an IUD. So that could be potentially very beneficial

1227
1:46:46,240000 --> 1:46:54,320000
for a patient who isn't looking to have a cycle versus the copper IUD I agree is another common

1228
1:46:54,320000 --> 1:47:00,560000
choice. But patients can actually see increased bleeding a lot of times. And so that could be

1229
1:47:02,400000 --> 1:47:08,160000
something that's of a concern for somebody who's looking to not have a cycle at all.

1230
1:47:09,040000 --> 1:47:15,040000
And I do, and I'm really grateful somebody brought this up because these individuals

1231
1:47:15,600000 --> 1:47:22,400000
may in fact have the abilities to still get pregnant. So testosterone is not going to always

1232
1:47:22,400000 --> 1:47:29,120000
provide a contraceptive effect for them. So they do still need contraception and to be thinking

1233
1:47:29,120000 --> 1:47:34,160000
about that. So thank you for whoever brought that one up. All right, next question, any secure

1234
1:47:34,160000 --> 1:47:39,520000
apps that you recommend to patients to track cycles, medication adherence given fears related

1235
1:47:39,520000 --> 1:47:44,720000
to who has access to the data? I don't know of any personally. Does anybody out there know?

1236
1:47:44,720000 --> 1:47:52,400000
Do you know of any great cycle tracking apps? I mean, I have the one that I use that I don't know

1237
1:47:52,400000 --> 1:48:03,360000
we are. Does anybody have any other that they recommend? Sorry, I'm not able to give you one.

1238
1:48:04,960000 --> 1:48:10,160000
And let's see, can you take self-reported blood pressure reading from the patient or

1239
1:48:10,960000 --> 1:48:15,600000
obtain the most recent reading from their prescriber? And I'm guessing that's kind of

1240
1:48:15,600000 --> 1:48:23,600000
getting at a telehealth sort of situation. I will say we are not quite there yet in Oregon to be

1241
1:48:23,600000 --> 1:48:30,400000
able to do this over telehealth. But we did actually include it in our protocols so that maybe in

1242
1:48:30,480000 --> 1:48:35,840000
the future when all the protocols are allowed to be telehealth, that that is what we could do.

1243
1:48:35,840000 --> 1:48:40,880000
What we would do is we would have the patient take their own blood pressure at home and then

1244
1:48:40,880000 --> 1:48:46,800000
report that to us so that we could count that as their blood pressure. So I personally think that's

1245
1:48:46,800000 --> 1:48:52,880000
fine. I'm not saying that that's necessarily in a lot of those statewide protocols though.

1246
1:48:52,880000 --> 1:48:58,800000
So you definitely need to stick to whatever your protocol is saying, regardless of like if it's CPA

1247
1:48:58,880000 --> 1:49:04,080000
or your statewide protocol. So I think it would depend on that. I think it's personally fine.

1248
1:49:04,080000 --> 1:49:08,640000
I don't know what you guys. Any other thoughts on that? Does anybody in the audience have thoughts?

1249
1:49:09,520000 --> 1:49:11,520000
Yes.

1250
1:49:24,400000 --> 1:49:29,760000
Awesome. I love that. No, that's another piece of information. Thank you.

1251
1:49:31,040000 --> 1:49:35,600000
Since this session is being recorded, we should use the microphones just because it is being

1252
1:49:35,600000 --> 1:49:42,240000
recorded for future use. But the comment was that the planned parent hit does take self-reported

1253
1:49:43,040000 --> 1:49:45,360000
blood pressure. So that's a great resource. Thank you.
